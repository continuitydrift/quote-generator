			"contents": "CONTINUITY DRIFT\n\na Novel of Comic Dimensions\n\nPREFACE\n\nThis novel is like a tree, something I keep in a little tray of my ambitions. Over time I attempt to prune into a suggestion of something larger. It has been a while since I've looked at it, and now, turning back to revisions, it is like an anticipation for the next season of growth, when the energy will travel up from the winter roots into branching chapters of spring. \n\nThe Human travels with a telepathic jelly-fish in a maintenance suit, on a novel-long trek all the way from the deep interior of the super-sentient planet-mob (I would say center, but the thing is so large it has no center) to the very edge, where the thin atmosphere of existing meets the freezing vacuum of oblivion. The suited Inhabitant abandons the Human about half-way through, to wait for it at a cheap dive called The Last Stand-Up in the port city of End. The human finds the suited comic, a spineless psychic floating in the biotic sludge of a forgotten world, playing out its weird routine to a dimly-lit room. Not some grand theater, or an operatic echo-hall of space, but a little, hidden side-show, a bump on the tongue of a flying worlds-amalgam, tasting the inconceivable backdrop of stars. There are multiple stages, such as they are, with various would-be raconteurs, and to hear the Inhabitant you would have to tune to his telepathic frequency.\n\nThere. This, I suppose, is the most apt image for the novel. I am the suited jelly-thing, at the end of the story, apologizing you came all this way, because the Xenians, the actors you were looking for, have already embarked on another illegal expedition. Illegal, because the thing that drew the human's attention, all the way back in the core registry, was that their ship had not been equipped with any sort of cryonic suspension. They had been alive, and conscious, for billions of years, and should have been insane. Now, they were off again, to another Sun-ship in the inter-galactic caravan, without having purchased the requisite storage for their minds. I can't see clearly who is in the club—some species are microscopic, or translucent, and anyway the lights are low. I see that the Human, though, is sitting there, using zombie-hacks to read my mind, so like it did when we first met, I'll make up a species-specific tale. \n\nFirst, though, I want to explain a few things about the novel that might otherwise be confusing, since I'm not sure which parts you will have read. In all six of the story arcs, the Earth has evolved with a crucial difference from our own: gravity can be locally reversed. This is a staple of fantastic literature, a metaphor, perhaps, for the suspension of disbelief required to read about alternate worlds. I read an online article, once, about how in anime floating castles/islands etc. tended to represent ecological well-being, in anticipation of a coming collapse. In two of the dimensions, I have adopted this motif directly: in X, exploitation and degradation of the natural world have left hardly any of the floating habitats left1, and in Y the ur-boreal habitats (as I call them) have disappeared completely. Imagine living in a world where there used to be flying gardens and floating cities, which have long ago crashed to Earth. \n\nAnti-gravity here is neither an invention nor the result of magic, but simply a quirk in the biology of the alternate worlds described. A certain kind of tree, in the eternal struggle to soak up energy from the sun, hit upon by chance a chemical process in which gravity was lessened. Later this urboreal species actually managed to invert gravity, allowing a kind of conifer to levitate. You can imagine plausible intermediary steps. On windy canyon slopes, or on the sides of mountains, the needles of a candidate species might change, due to selection pressures, to become broad and thin, in order to catch breezes and use them for traveling in a germinal phase. Think then of roots that specialized in grappling onto higher branches, working their way into the canopy as epiphytes. \n\nIs it completely impossible to suppose that some kind of mutation, or funky symbiosis with a fungus or lichen might produce the miraculous effect that most futuristic narratives claim humankind will invent? Nature, to my mind, with billions of years in which to experiment, seems more likely to have hit upon the secret to hover-boats and flying cities.\nSo anti-gravity, or apergenetics, has always existed in the multiverse of this novel, both as living trees and in a fossilized deposit they leave behind. This drift-fuel fills the role played, for us, by petroleum. A world with gasoline, I would argue, and the attendant technologies based on extravagant energy expenditures, would seem to an outsider no less improbably fantastic and magical than a world with levitating groves of trees, and root-bridges connecting them. \nContinuity Drift spans six different dimensions, separated by 120,000 years of chronological time. Although not time, exactly, since all of the dimensions, which appear to be situated along a single chronological continuity, are in fact concurrent, bound by a logic even more nebulous than that of plot and character.￹\n\nThere is no time travel in these stories. No paradox about altering the past. Dimensional travel, yes. Time is (from the point of view of the fictional universe and its narrator, an anonymous inhabitant of a space-suit of faceless prose) an epiphenomenon of denser fabrics, bended knots of other continuities, and wood totems of other worlds. \n\nWhat seems like traveling forward or backward along the slide-rule of chronological time is really a skewing sideways, shearing across dimensional continuities that, when their reality “catches up” with the chronological point of the original world, the not-quite parallel universe may have veered onto an entirely different evolutionary slope. \nThe narrator is an information construct that navigates between the noise of worlds, riding the ontological static of the cosmos. The inhabitant is also like one of the masks that the ice apes wear, that hold the telepathic visions of the past. I would like that mask, the voice, the one that I will from here on out adopt, to be open-sourced, allowing others to don the suit and tell other parts of the story. \n\nI would like to retain the rights to this novel, but not the exclusive ownership of the settings, characters, and concepts. As much of the map of the new, hypothetical genre of drift fiction I would like to make sure stays floating on the apergenetic energies of collective ownership. Without that, the core of the narrative, and its reason for existing, would be drastically altered. \n \n\nPROLOGUE: SEVERAL STAGES\nThe Comic Actors\nTHE story of the Infamous Comedians and their first journey through Europe began when Grazano, the wine-merchant who would later play the bumbling dottore, surprised the wounded mercenary, Lombarqo, slumbering in his wine-cart. Much of their later routines, the core of the comic dynamic between them, could be detected in that initial encounter, when the soldier, delirious with wine and wounds, breaking boxes and bottles, stormed towards the placid, unflappable merchant. Yelling threats in a language Grazano didn't understand, his sword-point a finger's-width from the merchant's nicest vest, bloodshot eyes the only thing visible behind beard and helmet, the mercenary's shouting crescendoed, peaked, then abruptly ended as he collapsed onto the grass. \n\nThe entire time Grazano hadn't moved, nor had the curious, eye-brow cocked expression on his thin face ever changed. He even continued chewing, cow-like, a mouth-full of bread and olives. Why? Normally, the human mind is difficult to read, and motivations hard to parse. Luckily, as a narrator, I have access to all my main character's inner thoughts, and can offer some explanation. Similar to how some animals will play dead when threatened with immanent danger, Grazano's instincts were to play dumb in the face of sudden or violent stimulus, his active volition retreating back into some far corner of his mind, as if to make room for the enormity of his terror. More than that, though, the merchant was struck by the bloodied and wine-stained soldier's resemblance to his elder brother, presumed dead after a recent battle of the air-borne citadels. His stunned mind spun with the impression that Lombarqo was his brother's avenging ghost, or even the roaring spirit of war itself, come to claim him as it had the rest of his family. The mercenaries appearance was so sudden, so unexpected, that it took on a cast of the supernatural. \nEven then, in those first few seconds of their acquaintance, the stumbling and screaming Lombarqo also reminded Grazano of the Capitano of the comedies, and he found himself rapt, as an audience member, carried back to his childhood when his parents would host troupes of itinerant actors, setting up their make-shift stage in the garden. So much turns on subtle twists of circumstance: fateful fulcrums that, though invisible at the time, determine large swings through distant futures. \nAfter months of hiding, healing, and learning the basics of the local language, the wine-merchant will convince the scarred Southern mercenary to escape conscription by hiding in plain sight, pretending to be an actor pretending to be a soldier. Just because that is what did end up happening though, doesn't mean that it was the only possible, or even the most probable, outcome. Even more coincidences had to occur before the stories of the two men were joined, and pushed in that direction. If the first word that the mercenary spoke upon opening his eyes hadn't been “dottore,” for example, then the chain of linked thoughts in the wine-maker's mind might not have drug them so deeply into the adventures that it did. The idea might never have formed. If Grazano had understood the gruff and grumbled speech of Lombarqo, or vice versa, they would not have developed the art of pantomime necessitated by mutual incomprehension. \nFor the past few years, conflicts between feudal lords and petty, papal principalities had escalated into open and destructive conflict. The overlords, or up-landed gentry encamped in their near-impenetrable keeps, vented their aggression on their rivals' lands below, casting them in shadow, dropping stones or burning pitch, and then as night fell and the lift from the up-root trees subsided, crushing deep scars, divots, and troughs in the Earth with the weight of the citadels themselves. Having conscripted and killed off most of the local masculinity, the noble families were forced to pay off bands of foreign mercenaries to swing swords and fire muskets on their behalf, and such was Lombarqo, who came far from the South—a land of sweltering sun, delicious fruits and burning passions. Like a parasite of bloodshed, he had followed the flying war-fortresses, with their braces of billowing sails, pulled by teams of straining oxen. When Lombarqo took his would-be fatal fall, while shooting a flintlock from the cantilevered battlements at the figures of men below (in the dim, sun-set slanted light, he knew his targets as the terminal points of extended shadows), it was a stack of hay for those long-suffering beasts that saved him. The strong wind and first grating contact with the ground had slanted the citadel, jolting scores of soldiers from their perches, sending them to smashing death below.\nThis was the pantomimed tale the grizzled mercenary brought to light over the weeks after Grazano saved him, how he had woke to smoke and the panicked braying of beasts and agonized shouts of men, crawling and stumbling to a nearby ash and char-choked stream, and sleeping again until the dawn he thought he would never see. Coaxed from the burly man with countless carafes of fermented grapes, he crudely acted out his sighting of the wine-cart, sneaking under the blanket covering the jugs and bottles while Grazano was relieving himself, and then the scene already described, with his discovery by the phlegmatic merchant, and his own histrionic attempt at robbery, murder, or intimidation (his fever-induced intentions weren't entirely clear) before his wounds overcame him, and commended him to Grazano's merciful care.\nIf the wine-grower's initial reaction of stunned immobility could be explained by Lombarqo's resemblance to Grazano's brother, or to an avenging deity of bloodshed, his later sheltering and kind treatment toward the mercenary was due to the fact that he viewed the war itself, and not the participants who happened to be on the opposing side, as the enemy, and the thing to be feared. Grazano assumed that the foreign musketeer had been enlisted against his will—not entirely true—in the same way as his own father and brother. Even if he had known then, as he later learned, that Lombarqo had volunteered to sail with the citadel for gold, his indignation would be tempered by the knowledge that nearly everyone, himself included, profited directly or indirectly from the war. It was no coincidence that the market at which he had been hawking his wines and vinegar was so close to the battlefield. The defending forces, with their fleet of flying man-of-wars and brigantines, needed supplies, sustenance, and diversion. However much the art of battle evolved differently on your flat and unfloating world, without apergy or up-root trees, that fundamental truth must be the same across dimensions: wars are won with rations and shoes that fit, as much as they are by sword and cannon fire.\nFor his part, Grazano tried to pantomime how the sky-war had enlisted, and ultimately killed, his father. A finely caparisoned horse, pennants playing in the wind, had ridden into the village of Torn and posted a printed declaration, in the same square where the Comici Malfamati would later stage so many of their early plays and ribaldries. Grazano's father was one of the few who could read the words, although all knew what it meant, and that night he munched grimly on slaughtered lamb, and told his wife and brother he had been called to war. None could refuse the summons of their lord. Ten years later, one of the Captains came to the vineyard itself, and his brother made a similar grim departure. Grazano's mother died not long after that, cursing all kings and nobles that lived above the common folk, along with the birds that ate the grapes from the vines, and clouds that never brought sufficient rain. Her mind, at the end, had become confused with sadness. \nSo he had been alone, and lonely, when the Spaniard2 burst onto the scene, another reason that the idea took root in his mind as strongly as it did. Two more visits, however, need to be described, before I can finish this preliminary account of how the Comici Malfamati formed, and get on with the rest of the novel.\nThe mercenary was nearly healed, learning the local language with astonishing speed, and helping Grazano with the sweaty tasks of picking and stomping grapes, when they spied a sun-bronzed, heavy-breasted woman coming along the village road, towing a younger, more shapely version of herself, who was holding, in turn, a bundle that could be nothing other than an infant. Telling Lombarqo to hide in the stables, the merchant watched the approach of the women with a fear nearly equal to that which he had felt upon the arrival of the Captain nine months ago, who had summoned his sibling to battle and death. The reason, I might as well tell you, is that in addition to reacting to immanent danger with unwarranted stillness and immobility, Grazano had another quirk of character: he was irrationally, inexplicably, and utterly terrified of babies. While the natural, human reaction to infants is one of cooing affection, nuzzling their stomachs and pinching their toes, the wine-merchant, all his life, had responded to the presence of newborns and toddlers with complete, incapacitating terror. They gave rise in him to a deep-seated, animal fear of death.\nThe matron, arriving under the vine-shadowed arbor, may have sensed Grazano's reaction, pressing her case as forcefully as her daughter pressed the almost-bawling infant against her bosom. The baby, of course, had been fathered (she claimed) by Grazano's brother, just before he went off to war. It now befell Grazano to do right by her daughter and grandson, and contribute to his support. The wine-grower had, out of necessity, been employing laborers from Torn to help with the vineyard, and they had no doubt been returning to the village with gossip about the young merchant living alone (Lombarqo was kept hidden) on the large, under-worked estate, with the grapes withering on the vine. In short, she proposed moving in with her family.\nGrazano, sweating, suggested that they walk around the vineyard, while the young woman rested with her child in the shady arbor. He brought them fresh-stomped juice, scooped into clay cups from a tub in the cellar. When they got back, however, the girl was nowhere to be found. It pains and embarrasses me to relate this part of the story, but doing so is necessary to convey something of Lombarqo's character, and why they chose the course of action—joining an itinerant troupe of comic actors—that they did. You have probably already guessed. The young mother was found, finally, in the stables, under the humping bulk of Lombarqo, quite literally rolling in the hay, their rhythmic groans reaching climax just as the door was darkened by Grazano and the girl's mother. Their stunned expression seemed mirrored on the wide-eyed face of the infant, who had been left in a nearby milk-pail, and was now watching between his chubby hands.\nSo that was the first visit that propelled them towards the idea and a sudden departure from the village. The second was a small caravan of improvisational actors and musicians. I may have mentioned how Grazano's childhood had been brightened by the periodic visits of this and other troupes that roved the countryside, like meteors appearing in the sky and bringing hints and portents of mysterious, distant worlds. Quite simply, he loved them, as he had loved nothing else in his life. This weakness might be heritable, for his father had always displayed a similar welcome and exuberance for the roguish performers. Despite the difficulty of their lives, Grazano's father had been a cheerful man, but in the orbit of the comedians he glowed with mirth, pouring out laughter as generously as he did his wine, drinking in their jokes and gossip with supernatural relish. \nIs it any wonder, then, that somewhere in his mind Grazano might have cherished the thought of one day becoming one of those actors himself, donning the bright costumes, wielding the slap-sticks and batons, shouting with profane glee the cosmic punchlines to jokes the universe had never told? Even as a child, he had understood that the masks had an odd power to say things that unhidden faces couldn't. Characters could go places that mere humans weren't allowed. Insults and uncomfortable truths that normally, when spoken, would incite violence or shame would, in the oddly-amplified voices of those painted half-masks, provoke laughter and relief. They even insulted the up-landers, the nobles before whom all were expected to silently bow their heads! Religion itself was mocked! Death, disease, and war were all reduced in the face of the Arleccino's batte into comic rags and puppets!\nTheir immunity to discipline and social taboo didn't stem from actual anonymity, since the performers would wander freely after the show, their features exposed, dropping their affected accents. Their protection came, instead, from a hallowed tradition, tolerance towards beloved characters having pantomimed their way into the villager's minds, their jibes and intonations echoing even in their sleep. The comic bits, or lazzi, had become embedded in the voices of the villagers, sometimes catching rides on passing caravans. ￹\n“The islands should be free!” the simpleton (Arlecchino) would shout. The young Grazano had agreed, watching the show sometimes as puppets and sometimes as acrobats. The ancient groves should float wherever the winds blew them, rather than being dragged by chains down rivers and across seas as living battlements to conquer and crush and make war against other islands, the consequences of which were always indeterminate politically but devastating for the villages and farms over which the citadels contended.\nThe Doctor was Grazano's favorite mask; he felt like he understood some of the jokes because he had read the books in his parents library, and they were things he wasn't supposed to know. It seemed like the Dottore was laughing at all of the oblivious rich to whom his parents served dinner, who interrupted everyone and repeated themselves at increasing volumes to silence any debate.\nVarious troupes had come through the village when Grazano was growing up. He realized from a young age that the exaggerated movements, either the pendulum swings of the swollen Capitano's, or the pranced footsteps of the slippered Dottore, were mostly a distraction, masking a level of communication beyond his naïve understanding. \nLater, acting as a Dottore in the Infamous Comedians, Grazano realized that the greater part of a troupe's business lay in carrying bribes and flattery from one location to another. “Tell them we've got the best carpets here!” a merchant would say over a meal he had paid for, or “if you play before nobles, say something about the tax on wheat...” from a farmer who cornered them in the wings. \nSome of the first memories of literacy Grazano had were looking at playbills, with the quick brush-strokes of motion and checkered costumes, the Harlequin, the old men, and the lovers. The lovers (inamorati) wore no masks. They were vehicles for poetry, love ballads, and mawkish sentiment, back when few humans could read, but their memories were sharp. Grazano was only the son of a wine merchant, somewhat wealthier than most, but the family traveled to various fairs and markets, where he would steal books, or in the course of selling his fermented grapes loosen the tongues of citizens and scholars, quizzing them for knowledge. He would commit sentences, whole speeches, to memory, astonishing his friends with the reproduced intonations and mannerisms of various adults. \nHe was called on stage once at one of the large hawker's squares that had been set up in a fallow field near a pleasant little town with a water-mill and thick-wooled sheep. In the distance were blue curls of mountains (this was before the sky-wars had started, so the horizon was free from the sailed battle-islands). The young Grazano had recited, with a perfect pompous accent of a professor from the floating universities on the coast, a paragraph from an academic article, complete with spliced quotations from ancient authorities in several dead languages (although laughably pronounced and jumbled). \nIn future years the players might recognize him and draw him again into their play, as a kind of apprentice-doctor assigned minor roles. His profession was one that encouraged volubility, and a slight air of gentility could add value to any bottle, so his father encouraged, to some extent, his reading and faux-learning, until it began to take up too much of his time. When Grazano's father was conscripted into the wars, his work left him little time for clowning, and drought and depression put a temporary end to the itinerant troupes of actors. Occasionally they would spring up in puppet shows, or a hawker's speech. Grazano combined, at every chance, his business with his art, performing the lazzi of the almost broken bottle to the astonishment and delight of his clientèle. \nIt had been a long time since any of the troupes had visited Torn. They seemed leaner than the merchant remembered, somewhat slower to laugh, with shoddier costumes, but their acrobatics and music were as brilliant as ever. As usual, they gave a performance first in the village square, and Grazano took upon himself the role usually filled by his father, inviting them to stay at the vineyard, exchanging food and wine for more of their music and impromptu theatrics. True to tradition, they removed the wheels of their wagon, upturning it to make a rough stage, which they set up in the garden by the arbor. The Arleccino and Dottore were from the old companie, and recognized Grazano as the precocious boy who had memorized their lazzi years before. They were genuinely saddened to hear about his father, mother, and brother's deaths. Walking around the rows of scrambling vines and pomegranate trees, the old actor confided to Grazano, “I've always dreamed of having a place like this...” The nomadic life, he confided, no longer held the charms that it once did. Besides, their troupe was falling apart. Their Harlequin was considering defecting to another troupe, and their Capitano had contracted the lung-disease and would be dead within the month. \nThe idea ripened, growing into the full and heavy fruit of an actual plan, ready to be picked.\nLombarqo's presence was no longer a secret, so there was no harm in him joining the other villagers to watch the torch-lit comedy. Soon, they both knew, a rider might come, dragging him either to the gallows or back to war. A deserter was worse than any official enemy, for he was an enemy now to all duty, and all honor. He had never seen a commedia show before, and was puzzled by the merchant's enthusiasm. As the performance began, Grazano was struck once more by how similar Lombarqo's accent was to that of the Capitano. With his dark skin and beard, the foreign mercenary's appearance fit the stereotype. \nThe idea swelled, pressing against his skull, until desperation finally forced him to venture it to Lombarqo. “Do you see that one clown, dressed in armor of the Spanish style, with flourishes of false bravado?” Most of the whispered words were lost on the soldier, but a pointing finger made, more or less, the meaning clear.\nThe mercenary growled. The egotism of the character, a laughable buffoon, was matched by his cowardice, and the scenes in which he played frequently ended in his retreat from real or imagined foes. Grazano knew that the soldier wasn't a coward. His scars, and the fact that he was still breathing, attested to as much. There were, though, other aspects of the mask that fit well with his character: the tales he spun, once he had learned to speak, about his battles and romantic conquests could not possibly be true, and his way of speaking was theatrically heroic and overblown, learned from military speeches.\nThe actor playing the Captain actually did speak a smattering of Spanish, and helped translate, between fits of coughing blood, the plan Grazano was proposing. “You could escape,” Grazano said, as they drank wine under the moonlight, “by pretending to be an actor, pretending to be what you really are.” When Lombarqo understood what the merchant was suggesting, he roared and uttered violent curses. Better to die than to make a mockery of one's own deepest self. \nAnd yet, eventually, he agreed. The only other options were conscription, either in war or adopted fatherhood, and the wagon-stage, pulled by a donkey and a mule, appealed to his sense of adventure. The old dottore would retire, and stay at the vineyard with the women and Grazano's presumed nephew, and the rest of the actors would accompany them as far as Venice, where they could introduce the would-be actors to one of the most famous (and beautiful) actresses in the Papal states or new republics. \nI might as well tell you how that all works out, because although it could have been, this novel isn't actually about that first fateful journey of the Comici Malfamati, but a second one, after Grazano is an old man, having grown into his mask, and the popularity of the improvisational comedies is already waning like a pale yellow moon above a new, unfriendly landscape. \nThe old Capitano dies on the way to Venice, after having taught Lombarqo the basics of the role. They meet Lucrezia, a famous actress, daughter of the inimitable Arleccino Tomolo, and both Grazano and Lombarqo fall in love. She admires Grazano and sleeps with Lombarqo, a triangle of thwarted desires and envy that propels their art and comedy into great success, while destroying their happiness and friendship. Ultimately, they fall short of what they had hoped to become. \nThey also meet an English dissenter and heretic, the Baron Okeon, a hunted exile who joins their troupe for the same reason as Lombarqo: to hide. He supplies them, for a time, with an astonishing store of stage-machinery, before going into hiding high in the Alps. What else? Oh, a Roma thief attempts to steal their gold and horses, and is instead enlisted into their company as a clown, tumbler, and musician. Maybe someday I will write all of those adventures, as I have tried to do before, but when this story arc returns it will have skipped ahead in time, because those first days, full as they are of feats of daring passion, pale in comparison to what happens much later, after the actors reunite, when the world begins to drift. \nThe Eldriss\nThey traveled to where the legends grew thin, and the stories didn't hang from every tree like they did along the main telepathic channels. The trees themselves were more sparse, so they had to abandon swinging through the canopy in favor of walking, less comfortably, upright along the Earth. The tribe had split into two groups, one of which took the easy path along the inland waterways, and the other scurrying over the cliffs, the cold wind blowing snow into their fur. Soon, they would meet the larger clan of telepaths to celebrate the shortest day, the solstice, and many were eager to gain some last feats of courage to claim before the fires. Or8o had passed his rights of ape-hood years ago, and was allowed to take the dangerous route, looking for any new landmasses that may have broken free from the sides of mountains, or floated in from the ocean. \nThe Eldriss, the Matriarch of the tribe, sat on a woven litter of up-drifting roots, her thin form wrapped in blankets of animal hides. One ape or another would pull the mat, which hovered chest-level above the rocks, although the Eldriss could control her own movement to some extent by shifting her weight. Younger apes thought that she used telepathy, a belief that the leader did little to discourage, in the same way that the Linguists who lived on the floating islands were reputed to control the ur-tree groves with the power of their will, when in fact they simply changed the direction of their drifting homes by the laborious practice of shifting stone ballasts from one side to the other. She was finely groomed, her graying fur washed and braided, with bone charms and bird feathers tied into her shoulders. It was an honor to attend the Eldriss, the highest ranking apes lining up at night to pick mites from her fur and apply the subtle dyes and knots that signified her exalted status. As they traveled, her mental imagery erupted from her wizened head like volcano, clouds of visions that grew brighter with the stars: fanciful panoramas of mythical animals and fire-wrapped ancestors, picking up the thoughts of her tribe and weaving them together, giving their wakeful dreamings more vivid contours and deeper, cabalistic meanings. \nThey came to a spot where the path through the chalky cliffs crumbled into the air, the pounding surf far below, and they had to wait for one of the clumps of air-borne trees, the scraggly, wind-stunted species that could survive the rocky cold, to fall low enough with the fading light for them to follow the single knotted tendril out into the salty sky. Gra3, Efsun, and other of Eldriss' close advisors slung the lead-chords around their bodies as they swung, paw-over-paw, along the vine-root to the platform, which sunk lower under the weight of the expeditionary group. They knew the route well, despite the relative lack of psychic markers and graffiti—every year a cadre of the more daring apes would take these suspended bridges and crumbling jumping-stones along the rookeries and cliffs, fixing any broken grapples and tying together any of the grove-clumps that had shifted. Blasts of chill winds whipped suddenly around corners, reminding them of danger, made more acute by the presence of their leader. She had insisted on coming, because this might be the last year-cycle this path was open to her telepathic tribe. By law, after the Linguist wars, all up-root groves that had grown large enough to be habitable were ceded to the speaking apes, who in return had given up their right to meddle with the Earth. So far, this cluster of youngling clumps had been kept far enough apart, and was sufficiently remote from the usual migrations, to avoid the attention of the mind-deaf tribes, but rumors were already reaching the Eldriss of the waterfall coven planning to bring their enormous island downriver, and then along the coast, adding even more trees to their considerable flying forest.\n\nIt will be difficult for a human from your dimension to understand the world I am trying to describe. The story of the traveling comedians, at least, had elements familiar from your own history. But telepathic apes? Your patience, perhaps, is tested—the premise is absurd. Nothing of the kind existed in what is known of your evolution. Your credulity will be stretched even further when I tell you that these apes, who were just beginning to diverge at this point, anatomically, between those that communicated with spoken sounds and those that could read one another's minds, weren't primitive at all. They had literature, art, philosophy, and astronomy, with complex rules and subtly shifting roles and social relations. They also, however, had one very simple, unalterable law: create nothing permanent. This was the taboo. No physical object or artifact could have a longer life-span than a single ape. \nConcerning your own past, you think that nothing interesting could have happened prior to the efflorescence of tool-making and cave-painting 20,000 or so years ago, because no evidence of earlier culture has ever been discovered. Surely, you think, before that lump of neo-cortex extended conscious experience into higher cognitive functions, it is ridiculous to think of proto-hominids as engaged in anything exciting. Consider, though, the possibility the brains of earlier primates didn't need to be so obscenely large, because they could work in parallel. Telepathy would allow for sophisticated cognition to take place in the cloud, so to speak, similar to what is beginning to emerge with your computers. Consider also that an enlightened species of ape, reaching the height of its culture long before any archaeological record, might have intentionally refrained from fashioning weapons or tools, lest lower or more violent primate species use those tools and weapons against them. I'm not suggesting that there was a corresponding branch in the evolutionary history of your world, merely that there could have been. The ice-ape story, after all, is set in an alternate universe, with floating vegetation. You should at least acknowledge, however, that the production of lasting, physical artifacts is not necessarily a precondition for an advanced society, especially in a universe where telepathy exists. \n\nHaving navigated across several of the small clumps of floating roots and rock in the gathering, salt-smelling dark, swinging across thin hand-bridges of braided roots and knotted vines (a mode of locomotion more natural to them than walking) they reached that day's destination: an uneven ledge in the snowy cliffs, otherwise inaccessible, leading to ancient and sacred caves. I thought you might appreciate the irony: they had been drawn by thought-rumors of ages-old paintings, deep in the caverns. The apes had come, though, not to worship or pay tribute the depictions, but to destroy them. The drawings, beautiful as the tribe recognized them to be, violated the taboo.\nThe shelf next to the caves looked like it once was used for signal fires. There was no clear violation of the rule against permanent alterations, but the ground was suspiciously even, the plants growing in sheltered niches just a bit too symbolically arranged. They set up camp, Efsun the ember-carrier, as always, over-doing the theatrics of opening the clay jar, that was an exception to the law against permanence, and would be destroyed upon her death. There is something I need to explain about Efsun, which might be a bit confusing. She had joined their band of apes several year-cycles ago, although her right to carry fire gave her great prestige, her sleeping mat often closest to the Eldriss, apart from Gra3, the greatest hunter. It was her calling, her deity-appointed task, to enforce the taboo, to burn everything that might outlast the normal nature-breaths of growing and decay. She wore a large mask and shoulder-plate of painted ur-wood, which she never took off, and this was the one exception to the rule that the tribe insisted others keep. The gravity-defying trees, you see, had other effects than simply floating: when carved from the roots or lower trunks, masks or armour could store the thoughts and feelings of the apes that wore them, and transfer those impressions to the mind of whoever wore them next. Efsun, then, was more than herself—she was the ghosts of the fiery warriors that inhabited the grains of her costume, which had been passed down several generations, escaping the flames she was charged with carrying.\nWhile holding telepathic energies, the over-sized helmet also blocked them, making her almost as hard to read as a Linguist. It was as if her “voice” was muffled, leaking from the edges of the thick, painted wood. \n“This fire is the same fire that is told about,” she thought to the nearby apes, her hands overgrown with a lichen of hardened blisters. As always, acting out their endless elemental back-and-forth, she was mocked by the water-carrier. Or8o helped arrange the stage, painting the stones with darkening blues that he took from the sky, transmuting into shared mental pigment. He used actual paint, as well, made from the pulp that was left after they boiled the sour-tasking brew from the ur-tree roots, that added strength to their telepathic powers. The Linguists, on the other hand, were known to chew and smoke the leaves of the same tree, which had the opposite effect, closing them off to the thoughts of other apes, casting them inward into the solipsistic dark, from which their only hope of communication was their obscene yelps and yappings. \nThe telepaths made noises with their mouths, but only as ornament to their conjured imagery. They didn't speak, they sang. The fire was set far enough back in the caves to protect the flames from the bitter wind, but not so deep that the shapes Or8o scrawled in the brightly-colored pulp, and more readily available mud, wouldn't be erased by the weather. As Or8o played his small ceremonial part he watched with envy bordering on a smoldering hate Efsun as she tended the fire. There was a longstanding rivalry between them, in part because the painter blamed the fire-carrier for driving from the tribe the ape he loved, the Eldriss' own daughter, Trela4. \nThey danced, howled, and cast their dreams into the night, and eventually runes coalesced from shadows. The moon was full and dark red, rising from a jagged gap in the mountains above them. Eldriss took the half-shaped images that were drifting around in the smoke and music, and made them into a long, long bridge. The tribe of the Finned Delta (named after the numerous fish that lived along their winter beaches), especially the half that had chosen the adventurous path, knew the concept of a bridge, although theirs were made out of fallen logs, and would wash downriver with every flood, or tumble, when rotten, down into whatever gorge or chasm they subtended. They also knew the connected sky-platforms like the ones they had just traversed.\nThe ice apes knew of bridges, but the one that the leader was describing to their hive-minded consciousness was different. It was larger than anything they had ever seen, too massive to even fall into the category of taboo, since they could not conceive of any apes that could have built it. It was so high in the air, she thought to them, that those who went along its trees didn't know if it was land or sea below them, and eventually forgot what the Earth was, having lived so long in the sky.\nThe bridge, the legend went, ended at this point, and was its one and only communication with the Earth, except, it was rumored, at the extreme other end. That was how the continent had become populated, tens of thousands of years ago. The bridge had crumbled and fallen long ago, although perhaps the network that it was connected to still survived, in high-atmospheric loops. It was as good of an origin story as any of the others the elders held, all metaphorical and tangled up with politics.\nThe ice apes were wonderful astronomers, with observations about calendrical cycles of the sky braided into their stories. The bridge allegory, with the lookout point as the supposed joint between the old world, where people lived entirely suspended on bridges, could be some legendary link between astral and terrestrial planes. They followed the Taboo, and crafted nothing with permanence greater than wood. Still, they had telepathic memories, or legends masquerading as such, of cyclopean architecture and ancestors who had walked onto the mountain trail marked with stacks of rocks and dense interlocking hieroglyphics, traveling along spirals, paths between the painted expanses of cliffs.\nOr8o, for some reason, loved the story of the world-bridge, or bridge-world, and wondered if the Eldriss' thinking of it helped soothe his anger at Efsun, and his perpetual rankling at the low status that he held. While I warned you against conceiving of the ice-apes as primitive, unable to replicate in psychic images the kind of complexity you ascribe to spoken or written language, it would also be a mistake to imagine them as inhabiting a utopia. There was much about their tight-bound tribe that Or8o and others found irrational and stifling, enough so that some, such as Trela4 and Or8o's childhood friend, Te2ao, left in voluntary exile, Trela4 to join the Linguists, and Te2ao to become a wanderer, charting a solitary path between the group-minds of the tribes.\nHis resentment returned when Efsun, Gra3, and the water-carrier took torches and sponges, to venture into the sacred caves and find the taboo works of art. He was the painter, and should have a chance to see them before they were washed away forever. After they had disappeared into the dark mouth of the cliffs, he took his auroch hide and some of the orange-red color of the fire, keeping it dancing before his eye-mind, and trudged off into the wind-blown snow, brooding on a nearby ledge. If the Coven of the Waterfall, the linguistic island, floated to the Delta where the solstice rites were held, then it would be war again between them and the telepaths. Trela4 would be on the other side. Efsun and the fire-carriers would try to burn them to the ground. He tried to fashion her face from the bit of mental fire he carried, mixing it with the lambent blue-grey of the swirling snow. Darkly, he muttered the one word in spoken language that Trela4 had taught him before she left: drift. She hadn't explained what it meant, but she wasn't so mind-blinded then by the Linguist's teaching that he could still get a sense of what the sounds implied: everything will change.\nYazisiz\nThe world would have no more writing. \nWithin days, the virus would be global, creating aphasias in those parts of the brain that processed the visual representations of words. People would still be able to speak, the scientists believed, just not read or write. There was no cure. The billion books, the vast repositories of language in the cloud, would become opaque and meaningless, codes without a cypher. \nIda, looking at the vertical sprawl out of the window, saw balconies caged in behind hyperdense pseudo-metal bars to prevent danger from flying boats, the view even without her lenses a mass of banners and fluorescent signs. Far below were the blue veins of the canal. She wondered what it would look like in the morning. In a week. She felt a stronger wave of the instinct that had been pushing her since they heard the news (or since the rumors and reports had reached that critical mass where they suddenly seemed believable) like she were in the sea and her toes could just barely dig into the sand: they needed to get away from the city. \nStrange, that it was the last night they would ever be able to read, and all she wanted to do was to talk. Her husband had made some guesses about what might happen in the next few weeks, but admitted that, really, he had no idea, how an entirely illiterate society might function. Surely there would be a dangerous period of chaos and transition, with opportunistic violence and looting. How could police reports be filed, or records of crimes maintained? Personal pasts, as well as those of civilizations, would become illegible. The world would be caught in a perpetual reset loop, where no information would matter because nothing could be saved. \nWhen, Ida wondered, would humanity have a period in which it would not be terribly surprised, in which it could breathe for a moment and try to construct a civilization compatible with peace and plenty? Throughout history, it seemed to her, as soon as a solution was patched together in the wave of one catastrophe another wave of unforeseeable disruption would wash over the landscape of human societies. First the drowned coastlines, the collapse of the oceans and the food supply, and now this. A new apocalypse of knowledge.\n“What are you thinking?” She asked her husband. She knew what he looked like when he was pondering something, and the fruit of it had ripened enough for her to pick from the tree of his silent meditations.\n“Honestly? I feel almost happy, and selfish for feeling so. It's like a confirmation of idealist philosophy, the solipsistic trap that you are the center of the universe, and if you close your eyes it disappears.” He paused. I might tell you about the particular philosophers he was thinking of, but of course they wouldn't exist in your dimension. Similar theories, though, crop up in nearly every world. Evrim didn't need to fill in the context, which she understood. Since his retirement more than a decade ago, he had been preoccupied with his failing intellectual faculties, which he interpreted as the onset of dementia. The notes he made in his books when he was in his prime, he now could barely follow, and more and more often names, words, and quotations would disappear, only their drowned shadows visible beneath the surface of recollection. He had already been bracing for the probable onset of senility, a gradual erasing of the legible surfaces of memory, so the illiteracy pandemic of the last few days held shades of an expected catastrophe in an unfamiliar mask. Now, it was as if the world were joining him in his slow descent, as if he were pulling the whole world down with him into the clouded space of wordless dotage. The rest of the world would go senile with him. Together they would be thrown back, without the crutch of print, to a childhood of thought, crudely symbolic, without the advanced tools of a legible inheritance. \n“Oh,” Ida said, “but think of Kamala!” Their daughter. The reason they had left to lament the worsening of the Earth they would leave behind. \n“She will be safe,” Evrim said. “If anyone can ride out this disaster, it will be the mega-corp Ginqualons. They'll probably even find a way to profit.” A touch of bitterness came into his voice. He had been disappointed when she left academia to work for the corporate governance, although he sympathized with her reasoning that they were the only ones with the resources to keep the world from tearing itself apart. Now, though, maybe she would reconsider.\n“If it is total,” Evrim had said, rubbing his chin, which had gone unshorn and boasted a winter crop of snow-colored bristles, “then this virus might be an improvement. The problem would be if there is a small minority, who can either quarantine themselves or find a cure.” Both sides of the cold war between cultural forces—transnational-capitalists and nethack levelers—could use the chaos of the virus to carve out a larger niche for themselves in the new ecological/political equilibrium, or, like recent species-disasters, it could give rise to a new, shifted state in which old categories ceased to hold descriptive power. When human potential and capacity for self-determination was drastically realigned. Ida was a historian, and her husband a philosopher. It made sense his outlook would be more optimistic. \nIda and Evrim Midahl were in their nineties, old even by 23rd century standards. Evrim, more optimistic, and with a greater appreciation for oral tradition, thought that it was possible, in the long run, for the return to spoken culture to be a step in the direction of progress—if not technologically, then socially. As long there weren't any readers left. \n“You think if there are some in the population who can avoid the disease, it might push the world back, give the corporatists more control?” \nApergenetic factories, aging and stressed beyond capacity, no longer had the drift-oil needed to maintain them, and the interlaced choreography of political and logistical support for fuel supply-lines fell apart. They lived in a fallen architecture of a more grandiose and wasteful age, an optimistic empire the ruins of which were about, finally, to drown. Just as the last reservoirs of the gravity oil were depleted, irreplacable forests destroyed to get at the lift-oil packed into their roots, the oceans were rising up to meet the falling cities on the coasts. \nA new kind of society had already begun to spring up, with a new season of legislative, artistic, and technological evolution. Animal populations, their genes altered to survive a heat-drenched world, were reintroduced. Buildings that floated in the air now floated in the waves, protected by huge artificial berms from increasingly common tsunamis and hurricanes. What had once been roads were now canals. Near the capitol models and prototypes for an egalitarian transportation system were hopefully far enough along that the population wouldn't be completely stranded. Enough of the old system survived, though, to make reaching the open waterways difficult, down from a vertical canyon of the city's wall-like apartment blocks. \n“We have to leave the city,” Ida said to her husband. \n“Not yet,” Evrim said. “Tomorrow morning, early. I want to read some more.” \nIt was the last night they would be able to. It was late summer, and sunrise would come quickly. Before then, the disease might have reached them, either across the ocean to their East, or across the mountains to the West. \nThey locked the door, and read the reports, noiseless, as they were filtered and processed by their personal aggregators. Local spots of light, charged from the panels in the elevator-garden, followed them as they moved from chair to chair, pacing, eating bread and cucumber from the fridge. \nEvrim made tea, and the two of them spent time hunting for a manuscript or just staring, dumbfounded, at one another, the words casting shadows on their wrinkled-paper faces. Evrim studied the stains in the tiny cracks along the rim of the tea-cup, wondering if that was what written language would look like, abstract and random? Constantly inviting but resisting interpretation? \nTheir dog, Telos, picked up on their mood, although he and his concerns would be affected least whenever the change happened. His wife kept holding out for some kind of a cure, but as more and more of the leading scientists and neurologists became infected, and unable to contribute, the chances for any kind of a vaccine or solution became increasingly remote.\nHe wondered what it would be like, reading as he became infected, if the letters would lurch suddenly into dyslexia, shifting into a language he didn't know. In the following weeks there would be videos online showing news announcers stuttering to a stop as their tele-prompters became indecipherable. They would squint, at first, as if the aphasia was just dirt on the screen, something that could be wiped off with a shirt-sleeve. The best of them, the most courageous, kept talking. \nIda, in the weeks after the virus was first discovered at multiple sites in Eastern Europe and Iceland, spreading from there along all compass points, thought that a global pandemic would spell (although no one would be left to read it) disaster, while Evrim began to see more and more long-term benefits that might accrue from global illiteracy. \n“It will be the great equalizer!” He had said, as they were clearing the table of books to be able to eat their evening meal. Outside the window, and through the sections of the wall rendered transparent by holography, the clouds were stretched and pulled into strange formations, like water trying to break through sagging cloth, or the underbelly of the apocalypse. There had been a lot of strange storms, recently, centered around the floating cities, bathing them in permanent clouds of apergenetic energies, the effects of which still weren't adequately studied. \n“Writing has been the tool by which, historically, a tyrannic minority of bureaucrats has held masses in sway, either by systematizing religion or codifying justice...”\nShe had read a paper, once, comparing the psychological need to place oneself above others through literacy and competency in manipulating abstract symbols to the need, physically, to live above those one considered inferior. Not just any kind of height was needed to convey the appropriate status: it had to be elevation at a cost, the more irreplaceable apergenetic fuel consumed the better. Even as the ecological consequences of harvesting ur-trees, and mining the mineral deposits of compressed apergenetic molecules became clear, the asinine game of one-upsmanship continued, every corporate headquarters, government office, shopping plaza, or stadium more nauseatingly grandiose, blooms of a dying empire. \n“So you think that those power structures are just going to disappear once books are no longer published? You think a new dark age will be kinder to the average person, without anything to keep the violence of the corporate state in check? Historically, it has always and only been laws that prevented utter subjugation of the lower classes, and the threat that any atrocities would be known and remembered. Without writing, there will be no law, and there will be no history. Tyranny can spread and fester unopposed.”\nAt that point, they both admitted, no one knew what the consequences would be. The media largely refused to accept the reality of how fast the Yazisiz virus was spreading, and focused on covering attempts to find an immunity, cure, or some other solution. Studies were frantically being done on victims at disease control centers, trying to determine how deep the neurological deficiency would extend. What about pictorial languages, sign language, or braille? Would humans suddenly be unable to appreciate other kinds of art as well, deaf to the hidden language of a painting or architectural design? Would programmers be unable to understand or alter the binary code or machine-language on which their entire 23rd century civilization depended? Most of the population of Earth had become accustomed to seeing the world through augmentation lenses, reality always added to by constant access to the cloud. Now that ubiquitous film, that filter the information age took for granted, would disappear. The reality this revealed might be grim indeed. Then again, as Ida's husband was suggesting, that dose of wordless truth might be just what the planet needed. Literacy might have been a kind of insanity, a memetic or mental virus that had caused the human species to nearly destroy itself. The megalopolis, the chimera-city that floated, wraith-like, over every population center, would finally disappear, it's spell of hegemonic culture finally broken. \nIda laughed, read something to Evrim, and he looked up at her suddenly. “Read out loud to me,” he said, “something else.” She asked why. “It is my last chance to hear you read.” In a way, it was true. Ida had been an actress when she was young, and still had many of her old speeches memorized, but reciting from memory was different than reading.\n“Here,” she said, pushing him the book. “You.” \nThey thought that the future might not be so bad. Global commerce would come to a halt. Coordinated efforts of large scale corporate empires would finally become an impossibility, with no way to conduct mass bookkeeping. Was any of that really tragic? Would any of those things be missed? Would more suffering result from the collapse of the global corporate-military bureaucracy than what had accrued daily as a result of its existence?\nWithout meaning to, they fell asleep. Ida woke first, and saw that the pages on the table near her head had faded into gibberish. Her husband, as if telepathic, had also come awake on the couch and followed her gaze to the meaningless print in front of them.\nThey packed, leaving their books behind. Evrim tried writing, but it was as the reports described: random scrawls. Yet he wondered, if it were actual writing, would he even know? If he sat at the table and filled pages of the notepad with penciled word-pictures, would someone without the virus know what he had meant to write? Maybe, instead of writing, he would become an artist. The Yasizis virus might turn everyone into abstract expressionists, with an unprovable faith that there was something more to their blotches and marks than the eye, rationally, could perceive.\nIt was, as usual, easier to travel down than to travel up, so they were better situated to leave the area entirely than to try to ascend to the metropolis in the flesh. That was, anyway, where the storms seemed to be coming from. They could take some public air-buses down to the outer boroughs, and then from there onto one of the main stations. Then...to Megalopolis, the real one, to look for their daughter? She was an ecologist, had some land near the capitol, a few dozen miles North. They decided not to take the car, rather to walk and hitchhike opportunistically. “An adventure,” Ida said, like she used to.\n\nLevelers\nThe jail cell stank. The wooden benches, extending just far enough from the walls, it seemed, to be slightly more comfortable than standing, were filled with drunks and vagrants. Those few spots not occupied were covered with suspicious stains, so Roger Malwise elected to stay on his feet, despite exhaustion. Besides, his bladder was full, the whiskey that the newspaper editor had given him for courage now demanding release. He had asked one of the guards, first politely, then indignantly, if he might be allowed to use the toilet, but they had ignored him. \n“Have patience, Reverend,” the warden had said when he came to unlock the clanking steel door, admitting another prisoner to the cell. This made Malwise wonder if the official had actually recognized his name, and knew he was the same clergyman who had been defrocked for heresy in Charleston years ago. He might have read the smear-filled biography published in the rival paper, which would explain both the sarcastic tone and his ill treatment. \nHis body, somehow, felt both cold and hot, warmed by the press of bodies and the adrenaline that hadn't quite worn off, and yet chilled from his wait in the police carriage, and then in the street, and then in the station while he was being processed. His skin was clammy with dried and nervous sweat. The excitement of the speech, and then the fear when the mob had stormed the printing room, combined to leave him feeling drained, his exhaustion adding to the unreality of his situation.\nRoger ran his hand through his thinning hair, and over his bruised and stubbled jaw where he had caught an elbow in the fray. He'd lost his hat back in the newspaper room. How could supposedly civilized men resort to violence and destruction so quickly, all account on political ideas? Anger and confusion played through his body, like the conflicting sensations of hot and cold. Politics was different than preaching, he had to remind himself. Though it seemed he might be an equal failure at both. Besides, hadn't the church's judgment on him after his apostasy been borne out? Hadn't he fallen, now, to this lowly hell of unwashed bodies and menial sins, while cursing, like a beast of lies, at the risen few whose position in the sky proved their state of grace? Though he no longer believed, his mind habitually turned to the same schemes of salvation and damnation, the quotes and tropes that had come to him so naturally as a preacher.3 Could it be that his loud denunciations of the rich were only a way to drown-out the constant self-recriminations in his head? Was all his wrath directed upward really only redirected shame and hate that should have been directed inward? Roger groaned silently with familiar doubt.\nHow quick the change had been, from what he had imagined as one of the finest moments of his life, the full force of his muse filling his sail of speech with soaring confidence (the alcohol hadn't hurt, he admitted), to this shipwreck of late evening. Early morning? He was no longer sure of time, the moon not visible through the small barred window high in the stained brick wall. \nMore than anything, he hoped that Lily was safe. He'd lost her in the mob, the broken glass. Was she waiting out there, in the front office, or somewhere on the street, as unsure of his fate as he was of hers? The righteous indignation that had filled him when denouncing the robber barons, and the corrupt politicians they kept in their pocket, was now replaced by the swelling in his bladder. He tried to recall the emotions of that moment, how he had almost welcomed the shouting crowd of the Mayor's men (paid by the Blinkertons, no doubt) as a visible instantiation of the forces he had railed against. He tried to see the guards, the warden, and the few slogan-shouters from that opposing crowd that had been stuck in the jail cell with him, in the same light, but the momentum was lost. The whole situation merely seemed stupid and pathetic. The drama of the scene was gone. \nTrying to take his mind off his beleaguered bladder, he went over the speech he had given in his mind. As usual, Lily had written the words, but Roger, in memorizing and then delivering them, had added his own touches here and there. The article published in the Herald, which had prompted the editor to invite him to speak, in advance of the upcoming city elections, had been largely her work. He like to think they were collaborators, but knew that she was far more talented. If only he had met her while still in the church, he might not have been stripped of his position for his disastrous sermon. She, though, a free-thinking woman, might not have fallen for him if he had not first fallen from his faith. For over a year, now, he had been planning to ask Lily to marry him, but something, probably fear, kept him back. In what church could they get married?\nAn old man with missing front teeth tried to say something to him, which Roger didn't understand. Eventually, he figured out, after several minutes of miming and being sprayed with spittle, that the drunk was asking for a cigarette. Roger shook his head and the old man said something else the ex-minister couldn't decipher, but that caused his cell-mates to laugh. Malwise was suddenly conscious of his clothing, his foppish waist-coat with the faux-silver watch-chain, his pants with the small tear along the seam of the left leg. How had he looked in the flash-bulb photographs that might appear in the morning edition, as the police had dragged him into the street? \nRoger wondered, briefly, if the newspaper editor, Merfield, might have arranged for the riot to take place, to boost the sales and circulation of his paper. If so, his plan had gotten beyond his control. While not carrying actual torches (everyone knew that the tinder-box buildings, once lit, would have set the entire downtown on fire), the supporters of the opposing party and their elevationist candidate, had overturned tables, wrecking the printing press, scattering its metal teeth of type, spilling bottles full of ink. \nWhat had he said that had impelled him to such violence? Merely that the underclass should not be worked to death in lightless despair. Having been involved with the church, he saw now how its teachings served to normalize and rationalize the suffering caused by the need to rise, to prove that one had the predestined blessings of the hanged God by emulating his qualities. Politics, religion, the landscape of the country itself were chained to the doctrine of ascension and verticality. The ruling elite of the Unified States, even more than Europe, seemed determined to cling to their extravagant sky-constructions, cities on the East Coast extracting fuel from drift-mines, freighting it across the plains, and burning it to send their edifices skyward so they can look down magisterially from their high estates and stations. The war had put a theoretical end to slavery, but the industrial cities of the North, tearing through the ancient up-root forests, sacred to the native tribes, turning their divine inheritance into belching abominations, huge floating factories chained to the Earth, frequently crushing those unfortunates underneath.\nMeanwhile laws were passed to quell political dissent. To be a leveler had become a crime, several prominent figures framed (it was commonly believed) and hung. The speech he had given bordered on illegality, providing the pretense for the mob to claim they were enacting justice. The charge, officially, had been inciting riot. For a while, he and Lily had felt some power antagonizing them beyond mere political opposition, some secret conspiracy pulling strings behind the scenes. The privately-owned Blinkertons, everyone knew, were collaborating with the police, to make sure the puppets their masters backed would stay in office.\n“Please,” Roger called again to one of the officers when another prisoner was shoved through the door. “Might a gentleman, however just the accusations against him, not be afforded the dignity of attending to his physical functions, in a manner in accordance with...” The policeman, scowling under the shadows of his starched felt cap, made a rude gesture his his fingers. The other inmates laughed. Roger, along with urine, felt rebellion swelling inside of him. There was a drain in the corner of the cell, and he was sure that he could smell the effects of a prisoner having done, earlier, what he now contemplated. He only hoped that Lily would not choose that moment to arrive. Fixing his eyes on the barred window above him, he pulled himself from his pants, and felt a glowing relief similar to that he felt on stage, or in the pulpit, letting the bottled up anger and eloquence flow unrestrained from his feverish insides.\n“Mr. Malwise,” a voice shouted from behind him, as the steel door slid open. At least it isn't Lily, Roger thought, but his warm relief turned to a cold spike of shame as he turned and saw who it was who had addressed him. Not Lily, but her father. \nHe had never met the man, but certain details of the description his lover had given him rendered the identity unmistakable: he had lost an arm in the war, and had a dented scar on the left side of his forehead.\n“Mr. Evers,” Roger said, his hands held awkwardly to his side, not sure if wiping them on his waist-coat would add to the indignity, doubting anyway if this imposing ex-soldier would offer his hand. “Lily, is she...”\n“She is safe,” her father said. “You will never see her again.” \nThe Human\nThe Sunship Continuity, vast beyond worlds, wound its ponderous way through space and in between the spaces of dimensions. It was a collector, maximalist, always adding to its menagerie of forms and formulations, striding galaxies and compiling biospheres, always growing like a snowball rolling down a never-ending hill. However large you are imagining the Sunship, a mega-planetoid carving a deep swath through gravity, I would ask you to increase your vision exponentially, until it pushes snugly against the edges of what is possible to think, brushing against infinity, and still it sails through darkness, growing, aggregating, exploding in impossible impulses of size, seismic convulsions and realignments. The scale of the Continuity loomed in time as well as space, cycling through aeons and ages of evolution like circadian rhythms, awaking to new internal universes, closing its eyes on galactic annihilations, sliding unperturbed through cyclopean dark. Innumerable organisms and psychic super-organisms flashed in a endless configurations, irrespective of whatever tiny terrestrial sphere from which they might have been collected, thrown into a massive meta-ecology that drew from gene pools as deep as time, and as weird as all the dimensions it had ever floated through. \nThe rest of the worlds described in this book actually exist. The Sunship, I admit, is a fiction. To readers in your dimension, I realize, this admission will not matter, since all of what I write will be taken as imaginary. No one knows why the Drift happened, enveloping worlds and throwing them into contact, dragging them into the shared, post-historical meta-verse that we now inhabit. Novels about the transposition storms are one of the most common inter-dimensional genres, since those of us who have known nothing other than a porous multi-verse remain fascinated by what it must have been like for those planets trapped in their own continuities, getting their first glimpse of parallel realities as they bent into intersection. \nYour world, I have to remind myself, knows nothing about the tradition to which this narrative belongs. Because it has no apergy, no anti-gravitational trees, the Drift might never happen. Physical transpositions between your world and others might never occur. As an information construct, I am able to send words through the paradox gate, although it is illegal to do so. If caught, I will say that the composition of this narrative is nothing more than a literary device, imagining a hypothetical audience in a pre-Drift world where no ascension species have ever existed. Your world is so absurd to us, so redolent of myth and parable, I would probably get away with such a lie. The truth is harder to believe.\nThere are certain conventions of the Drift-novel genre that I, as a narrator, have adhered to. Six different Earths, but with some fanciful or speculative invention that attempts to link them together, explaining somehow the inexplicable. My own contribution to the well-established genre is no exception. The meta-story of the Sunship is in a way my parody of those presumptuous frame-narratives that try to out-do one another with scale and grandeur. The hero of this story arc, sailing above or beneath the others, will simply be called the Human. \nThe designation is sufficiently unique, since no one had been human for a million years. It was an obscure species, bipedal and without telepathy. The Sunship classified the morphology as sub-sentient, from some back-water dimensional cluster, one of innumerable carbon-based permutations on a too-common theme of animated clay. The Human's friends considered it's form a demotion, after having inhabited one of the greater insect swarms in the meteoric marshes. A Karmic catastrophe, an example of what might happen when focus and initiative were lost, a lesson in how far one could fall in the impersonal estimation of the ship's systems. They avoided it now, speaking in frequencies beyond the Human's hearing. It didn't care; the social exile gave it time to think. \nFor a while, it was the best form the sub-sentient could afford, but after the Human had lived and died several dozen times, it grew fond of the quaint and limited physiology, the stunted meat-thinking that held a perverse charm of self-importance. After all, the irrational creature thought, the sentient ratings of the ship might be wrong. The light-yearly lists so many of the inhabitants obsessed over, dreaming of climbing up the bio-corporate ladder into one of the behemoth meta-fauna systems showering nanites on masses of their lesser subjects, might not reflect the true value of organisms. The Human, or the trans-sentience that now found itself a human, was tired of the ceaseless competition, the scrambling for super-sentient DNA. The ecology of the ship was like a crowded puppet show, with too many intelligences clamoring for the strings. Too many tricks and elbows to push entire quadrants and continuity clusters out. Humans, she had known before she chose to become one, were insignificant compared to the Xenian clouds and sentient populations in the outer rings, and nothing she did in this form would ever really matter. Maybe, however, the constraints of her existence lent it an elegance missing from the hierarchical megalomania of the executive rosters. In the minimalism of these two arms and two legs she might find something missing from the operatic power-plays of the alien titans.\nThe ship was supposed to be so advanced, so enlightened. So much, though, was kept inscrutable, and unopen to transparency or debate. Sub-sentients weren't protected legally, and were therefore subjected to the worst exploitative schemes of a thousand dimensions. There were parts of the ship, in her present incarnation, where she couldn't go. \nThe core and corridors, anywhere open to the stars and sky, were public and protected wilderness, and she could travel any path where she wouldn't be poisoned, hunted, or conscripted. If she had been a later or earlier evolutionary form, a telepath, she would have been in more danger from thought-sinks and meme mobs. The tunneled axes were like canyoned waterfalls as deep as several planets, glowing with apergenetic veins and the back-draft from ship engines, the rock shadowed with sails. \nThe interior of the star-ship, anticipating the claustrophobia that would be felt by terrestrial organisms, was divided into quarters, like a fruit, held apart by near-invisible threads of scaffolding. No matter where you stood in the Biopolis, the city of archives, there was somewhere above you a grooved sky of stars, a ribbon, no matter how thin, your mind could follow out into the vacuum. The shield was barely visible as a red-shifted meniscus, behind which the planetary rings would at intervals rotate into view, flaring with reflected light. Spider-webs of cables connected transport platforms, while strings of cargo palettes floated by in the higher lanes.\nAs the sunship passed the wings of a nebulae or ominous absence of a black hole or name-eater, the super-sentients would tilt the ship, giving the migration lanes a clear view of the phenomenon for dozens of light-years. \nThe human stared down at the lattices of bio-mechanical constructs and localized ecologies and gravity fields, streams and waterfalls of liquid data-media and trees of archival storage. She was going to see a troupe of entertainers, recently arrived. Most sub-sentients on the same Karmic rung as the Human were assigned ultra-menial jobs on the sunship, but in deference her previous incarnations she had been given a job processing arrivals, checking logs for contraband or inconsistencies. The pay was terrible, but she met interesting organisms. Something about one particular ship, called the Lambent, had bothered her, and it was only years later she realized what it was: there had been no stasis equipment on board. The life forms the actors and musicians were inhabiting weren't capable of auto-hibernation, but the possibility that they had been awake for the entire distance was unthinkable. She checked with the archives, and the experts all agreed that the travelers, after so much uninterrupted life, should have arrived at the starship gibbering lunatics.\nThe Human hadn't trusted the experts. If it was a mistake, they might garnish her pay. If it wasn't a mistake, she wanted to learn the secret for living through so much time-space without putting your mind to sleep. \nThe sea sloshed and curled above her, caught in neutral gravity field, obscuring to some extent the view of the opposite hull, hanging upside down behind the distant mist. Its aerial tides and directions determined by a vegetal layer of distributed microbes, the inner sea provided weather for the settlements around the docking bay. Landing platforms dotted the interior like flowers, with smaller vessels and sleds hovering nearby, solar sails folded along nanite poles, their engines glowing with apergy.\nHer interest in the Lambent Drift had something to do with her humanity. If she could prove that the swarms were wrong about the possibilities of non-hypnogogic travel between stars, as was rumored in the barbaric days of early space, then they might be wrong about collective intelligence as well, and telepathy as a prerequisite for true sentience. \nHumans, she thought, had individuality. This is why the viral evolution that ended the species was thought of, by its victims, as a zombie plague, because they feared the mob-like connections telepathy implied, at the same time idealizing it as a secret cure for loneliness. She couldn't really know what it had been like for them. Her identity had been formed, like trillions of others, in the ship's engines, and although her algorithm was tied temporarily to a fore-brain heavy ape, there was no way for someone, like her, who had once seen the interior of a Sentient cloud, to ever really go back. So much of who she was had been rendered invisible, folded into inactive segments of her sequencing, but she knew they were there, waiting. \nThe ship, too, had no way of simulating what generations after generations of non-telepaths would have created, as an external prosthesis for true collectivity or culture. The artifacts that survived were fragmentary, although she thought there might be sufficient material about the lost species to publish a song about them in one of the lesser gates. The actors from the Lambent had given her hope that this was possible. They were, if she was honest, the reason that she had committed the bizarre transgression of staying, over a dozen lifetimes, in human form. She had been human when she first saw their performance, that had begun her centuries-long obsession with their play. It had made an impression on her that she couldn't explain, greater than the dust storms in the outer Albernath, or the dance of the drowning stars she had been taken to when the swarm-clouds had, for a brief time, folded her consciousness into theirs. Despite having glimpsed the cosmic aestheto-objects of quant-entropic manifolds, it was the dusty theatrics of immigrant vagabonds that had sunk their hooks into her merely fleshy imagination. She was afraid if she stopped being human, she wouldn't be able to watch their show in the same way that she had.\nShe had spent hundreds of years watching their dialogues and declamations. They did transmit telepathically, of course, but they made sure, whenever she was in the audience, to speak out loud, in the standard meat-speak of the menials, inflected with a strange poetry borne of half-translated impulse. After that first show, she had talked to them, discharging what she had told herself was the reason for her visit to the lower wharfs, following up on her investigation.\n“I checked your ship through a year or two ago,” the human had said to one of the actors she remembered speaking to before. He had six arms and a tail that looked like the end was missing. In the show, he had juggled and played music, taking on the theatrical role of a bandit from the time of the Demph mutiny, laser swinging from his hip. He had been her favorite. His name was Zaoth, she remembered “I wanted to ask you some questions about it. First, though, this show...I really liked it.”\nZaoth had nodded. “This was more of a rehearsal, really. We've been working on it since we landed. Your form is rare, so it caught our attention. Usually we try to keep our audience in mind. You're a...?”\n“Human,” she had answered. “Pre-zombie.”\n“I've heard of them,” Zaos had said. “And thank you. What did you want to ask?”\n“There was no stasis equipment on board,” TreLa4 said. “And no subscriptions to proprio-somatic or onieric feeds.”\nThe alien gazed at her, his eyes becoming momentarily dark. “It wasn't that long of a journey,” he said.\n“You traveled nine million light years,” TreLa4 said. “With only a few hundred actors, musicians, and storytellers. You were awake the whole time, running your minds at full speed. That's supposed to be impossible.”\nThe sounds of the ship foundries and the howl of salty winds whipping around the inner hull filled the space of his silence, until he finally spoke. “Yes,” he said. “We were rehearsing.”\nShe had become a regular after that. Now, she was going to see them for perhaps the thousandth time, in the latest of a dozen human bodies.\nThe massive arcades, lattices, towers, and stations reminded her, as they always did, of her own insignificance, and the number of lifetimes it would take before she could hope to earn enough to enter again into any of the sentient councils. Her mentors in the swarms would laugh at her if they saw her now, an ancient biped, unable to hold in her primate mind the first sequence of algorithmic logic chains that used to flow, like a tide of information, through her thousand wings and thoraxes, flashing across her manifold inner vision. They would pity her, but at the same time think that her existence now confirmed some inherent flaw in her personality algorithms, a lack of ambition, or a weakness. \nShe had studied dimensional ecology, and for a while it seemed her thought-songs might be adopted in some of the pilot protocols, but she had never ironed out the mistakes, and after a few thousand light years they had shunted her consciousness, politely, into the lower cybernetics, and would have ended by sending her back to the rings had she had not accepted a contract for a few thousand lives as a menial vertebrate. Nothing was done personally—her sentence was delivered through the objective economics of the Starship, which were never wrong. Every sentience, the prevailing myth declared, rose or sank to the level it deserved. \nThe sky-bridge was filled with inhabitants, but because of differences in time perceptions, most were either statues or blurs of color, slight drafts of wind, carrying scents from distant planets and dimensions. Although she was the only human, she would occasionally see zombies, ice-apes, or bipedal gaia-suits. She would listen for their thoughts, before remembering that her brain wasn't capable of hearing them. The form of sub-sentient she had chosen was not as intelligent as a single zombie in a horde, or as a single ice-ape telepath in psychic range of others. She had initially chosen the mind-deaf variety called homo sapiens, however, because their individualism allowed them to survive relatively independently of social groups or natural environments. They were adaptable, and they were cheap. \nAs an inhabitant and citizen of the Starship Continuity, she had the right to regenerate as any of the basic types of organisms held in the public domain, provided she could pay the fees. Humans weren't one of them, technically, but on the other hand they weren't valuable enough for one of the ship's conglomerations to have laid claim to. It was only because she had lived as a sentient that she knew about this loophole, sometimes exploited by insect clouds when they needed a few million years vacation. \nThe human, before she had been one, had gone through several accelerated lives as a distributed node in a swarm of dragonflies, part of a living eco-computer that played a small role in the evolving structure of the ship. After that, he took a few hundred-year shifts a cyborg, compelling nanite assemblers. It was only then he had registered to become human.\nSome of the humans she had inhabited had lived for hundreds of light-years; some never reached adulthood. She would walk the same bridge down to the docking shell, stopping for a day or two for the jugglers and musicians, and sort out compatibility issues with the older models of ships as they flew onto the platforms. No matter how many incarnations she went through, she barely managed to pay off the interest on her debt to the ship's systems and collection swarms, and began to think she would have to be human (or worse) forever. In the decades when she wasn't needed, she researched her adopted form, dismayed by how little there was in the archives. \nThe history of so many species had been lost. Dimensional science, supposedly, rendered archeology obsolete.\nThe politics of the starship made her head hurt, as they had even before she had dropped down the evolutionary ladder to the obscure rung of homo sapien. Looking above her, the alien ecologies navigating, reconstructing, and powering the starship blended in her mind with the obscenely detailed grid of lights, uniform in neither size nor color, but like a tree with a trillion leaves turning in the wind, reflecting hidden sunlight. They were equally distant, equally inscrutable of meaning. They offered no hope for navigation. The theater, with the odd group of castaways and comedians, was the only thing that made sense.\nBesides the alien with extra arms, there was a symbiont, half a dinosaur-like sauroid without any arms at all, and half a cybernetic crab that clung to its shoulders and supplied the missing appendages. Their names were Smuggler and Xi, he learned. There was also a giant female with three mouths, on her neck, face, and forehead, who could sing and speak in three part harmonies, each orifice supplied by a different set of lungs. She and Zoath, the one with multiple sets of arms, were lovers. A set of heat-feeding pinwheels led a group of dancers, while a few dozen anti-gravity rod-creatures hopped about like pogo-sticks. \nThey told the human that not all of the answers were available from the data-clouds and archives. Inhabitants of the inner shell lost sight of the vastness, the inexplicable scale of the chaos of the ship. Although everyone on board was classified as level two sentient, his manner towards the human was not condescending. \nThe size of the starship was incredible. It was more the size of a sun than a planet, and appeared much like a sun to the planetary rings. Entire solar systems had fused together across dimensions to build its living hull, and a million sentient worlds had designed the shield that kept the ship safe, and the engines that would power it using the energies of the drift itself. The terrestrial cores had gone into the computers, and the liquid hearts of the megacities. \nThe ship was on of a fleet of an inter-stellar caravan. The human saw echoes of her own species' nomadic tendencies, but the analogy was misleading because the scale of the starship was one her biological mind wasn't equipped to comprehend: billions of sentient species, trillions of organisms, and the bio-computational capacity to run models for a few thousand Earth-sized ecologies. \nShe had ran a few life cycles as an ice ape, and a later form of zombie, but for some reason it was the hairless, mind-deaf variety of homo sapien that caught her imagination. There were so many species in the archive, and the ship knew so little about them. \nThe human had been born ten billion light years after the starship continuity left its home-world, so she didn't feel the same sense of purpose in reaching their destination, some habitable sun a trillion light years away. The ship was home to sentient inhabitants from thousands of alternate dimensions, worlds far along the drift. \nThe starship was not unique. It's populations, rings, protocols and structures (organic and inorganic) were all worked out in advance over millennia of trial and error, on hundreds of first, second, and third wave interdimensional ships. These different crafts were kept isolated by the inviolate speed of light, and citizens spent most of their time is stasis. The sociology of space, the mechanisms of regeneration, tribal politics, and mass entertainment, all evolved at scales far beyond the level of individual organisms, as a secondary ecology of memory and information. As a single human, the thought that she had any say in determining its course was ludicrous, despite the rhetoric of democratic governance. It was a democracy of drops of water in a sea. \nThe Human made her species a kind of research project, sacrificing her standing in the ecological circuits and wasting her dwindling resources on research into the archives. There were trillions of sentient creatures awake, and that many light years of travel as precedent and history. The bandwidth of surprises in her existence was narrow. \nShe reached one of the gravity spikes and stepped onto an empty platform, looking over the rail as it dropped down to the lower levels. The enormous jelly-fish creatures drifted in the spray hanging beneath the ocean. The air was salty, heavy with the chill of vacuum coming through the shields. The theater was in a noisy and overgrown area of the biocity, where mechanic/gardeners repaired ship components, or welded together assemblies, filling the streets with clanging and arcs of light. The theater was on the second floor, above an optimistically signed office of tourism.\nThe actors, for the first time in all the centuries since she had first checked their ship through the archive-city's customs docks, weren't in the theater. The only one from the troupe that was left was the gaia-suit, with the floating jelly-fish brain. He was doing stand-up. The audience was small, and they all turned to look at her hairless, naked form as she walked in.\n“Ah, a human,” he was saying to the odd assortment of forms, including a flock of butterflies and a giant pinwheel, making slow turns in the apergenetic vents. “Humans are great! Whenever they imagined the future it was like Captain so-and-so saves the galaxy from the robot plague or mindless...well, they did have zombies, I guess. They had everything in their time-lines. For some reason, though, humans always wanted to think that their existence was a cosmic key.\n“Even after the drift,” he went on, “when they knew that there were other dimensions, they somehow thought that these other worlds revolved around theirs, and were somehow derivative, less real. Humans would have been Demphs, if they had the chance. Before they all turned into zombies, of course.” He nodded at the human, and the audience laughed, finally realizing why the strange biped looked so familiar. \n“Here is the problem with the spaceship scenario those ancient bipeds imagined as their chosen future: it was a classic technological wish-fulfillment, where the physical body and natural world could be studied, controlled, and ultimately escaped. Six billion years of evolution, with all of the interlaced intricacies of macro and micro ecologies, chemical transfers, the experiences of innumerable forms of life across geologic time scales, and in a few thousand years of laboratory science humans thought they could turn their scorched and wasted world into a launchpad to the stars. They tried to out-think (or un-think) an entire planet with a circuit board. What did they think they would eat? Where did they think they would eventually land?” \n“The fantasies of starships weren't really about space, after all, as much as they were about a particular vision of the Earth: metal, molded, and steered by a hierarchy of military command as simplistic and absolute as the treeless ship itself. There was usually a Captain, a Doctor, and a pair of lovers to advance the plot. In none of these narratives, the stories they told about their special destiny, was there a single bird, or fish, or insect. There were a lot of uniforms, and buttons to push, and evil aliens.” \nThat was another surprise for the species I've adopted, the Human thought. More advanced societies did evolve, and undreamt of technologies did appear, but they weren't made by humans; they replaced them. There were aliens, but they didn't come from space.\nAfter the show, the Human bought the gaia-suit a radiation lamp, which he thankfully set on the floating slab of table, the transparent or translucent sections of the suit pulsing warm colors in the subdued blues and purples of the club. He plugged a tube from the backpack into the wall, after which he seemed slightly more relaxed.\n“I'm looking for the actors,” the Human said.\n“They left.” the jelly-fish like thing in the helmet pushed its filaments against the glass. “They sold the ship, and are headed to the outer rim.”\nThey reminisced about the show, which had gone on for so many years and life-cycles. Even discussing it, hitting on the major points, days passed. The pin-wheel proprietor, turning itself horizontal, brought the Human food when she needed it, the suit content to get its sustenance from the hook-up with the wall. Finally, when a band of dinosaurs was on the stage, they decided to go for a walk along the sky-bridges and hanging gardens. \n“I can't believe they are gone,” the human said.\n“We could follow them,” the suit-thing answered. “I was never very good at this stand up comedy thing anyway.” The Human was silent for an hour or six, considering. It would take several hundred more of her human lifetimes. She would lose her job, maybe drop down into an even lower Karmic instantiation. Above them, the huge canyons and upside-down lakes of the sunship reflected the lights of the Biopolis. \n“Let's go,” the Human said. \n\nBOOK ONE: CONTINUITY\n“Everything is connected.”\n\n \nCHAPTER ONE: THE AGE OF THE ICE APES\n\nWATERFALLS poured into the valley of the Linguists, a fern-covered bowl hollowed out of the mountains. The floating island had once been a part of the cliffs, thousands of years earlier, before its grip was eroded by the currents, and the mass of earth and ur-trees had drifted out over the water. The anti-gravitational roots held the floating grove together, an enormous saucer of flying vegetation, while keeping it suspended above the spray. Paths, guarded by Linguist warriors, threaded down from notches in the high peaks, becoming thin gangways and bridges reaching out to the trees on the apergenetic shelf. Only a few vines and tendrils anchored it to the edge, and now, if the council had its way, those thin ties would be cut, the bridges severed, and the island of the Linguists would drift off to war. \nThe council of nameless priests had decided that the island of speaking apes would float along the coast, collecting the stray groves of up-root trees along the cliffs, growing ever larger, reaching higher into the sky. How huge and ponderous, TreLa4 wondered, did it need to grow? There were rumors that the new, enormous land masses floating above the Earth were responsible for the spreading cold and deepening snows, growing worse with every season.\nIt was freezing, the night that TreLa4 left, with the moon almost full, and wind filling the valley with icy mist. The trees, their roots gripping the caves and crevices riddling the island, generated some warmth, but it was quickly lost, rising into the night. The resonance of the apergy in her mind was enough to drown out the dreams of the apes sleeping beside her, even if they had been telepathic. She lay awake in her blanket of leaves, going over her plan in her head, and what she would say if she was caught. Everything was going to change. \nOf course, the truce between the Linguistic and Telepathic tribes that had held since before her birth, was going to end no matter what she did. It was only a matter of time before the world once again was engulfed in war. Time was a waterfall, and she was about to be swept into unknown rapids, so she might as well act now, although all of her instincts told her to cling here, to relative safety. Every year the gathering season was shorter, with hunger driving some of the famished tribes to heresies: eating the flesh of animals, making stone tools, cutting down living trees to plant their own vegetables. The linguists, even with the tributes and the gardens (hardly any of the fruit was allowed to fall down to the fisher-apes below), were beginning to worry, and she kept hearing rumors about what was in the lower levels of the island, down by the gravity-worm nests and levitation-snakes, where none but the nameless priests were allowed to enter. Hidden rooms filled with stone carvings, or telepaths kept prisoner, tortured...\nBefore the cooling period, which had begun a hundred years ago, there had been huge forests full of smaller groves of ur-trees, growing so thick and low that an ice ape could swing from one end of the continent to the other without touching the ground. So the legends said. Now, after the linguistic wars, all of the smaller islands had been tied together by the roots, brought into unnatural shelves of looming rock and wood that during the day would rise, if not tied by blood-vines to the surface trees of Earth, almost out of sight. The ur-tree roots, used by the telapaths for their rites and recreations, had in that age been freely harvested, rather than begged for and bartered from the Linguists who maintained strict control. \nStepping past the recumbent forms of the other students, TreLa4 felt fear tightening her chest. The grove of scholars was a group bound by a shared sense of alienation from the larger tribes. Language using apes, after the wars, were a minority, despite the titan groves they now controlled, feared and shunned by the mind readers. At the same time, they were the keepers of the histories and hidden meanings, and held by the land tribes in awed respect. The elder sages made the neophytes feel that the grove was the only place they would ever belong. Some even thought, and whispered darkly, that the mind-deaf apes were the future, bound to rise and retake their place of dominance. One of the apes, a male TreLa4 had spoken to once or twice, turned in his sleep as he walked by, causing her to pause and hold a nervous breath. \nTreLa4 had heard stories about the floating groves when she was young, and had dreamed of studying there. For generations the two sub-species of ice apes, those who used audible speech and those who used telepathy, had been in conflict. The Linguists distrusted the Telepaths' ability to commune directly with one another's minds, and the psychic tribes feared the mysterious sounds made by the Linguists to compensate for their deficiency. Shunned by her clan for her own mind-deafness, TreLa4 had longed to travel inland and learn the secrets of spoken language. Now, after two years on the flying island, she wanted to leave.\n\"Do you think they will take you back?\" the nameless priest had asked when TreLa4 had gone to see him in the central glade, a separate ring of trees floating above the rest of the suspended forest. Part of his skull had been removed, and replaced with a painted gourd. She had pleaded with him to let her leave. Shelters of stretched hides dotted the lower gardens, nest-like hammocks of woven leaves dangling from branches, and below that the forest rolled out from the mountains along both sides of the river, the sky still gray with the end of winter. The ur-trees lessened the effects of gravity everywhere on the island, but especially in the higher canopy. TreLa4's legs and arms had grown weak, in the same way she had all but lost her telepathic powers. Returning to the surface, to the nomadic clans of her birth, would be impossible. It had been too long, the nameless priest told her. You know too many of our secrets. For TreLa4's own safety, he couldn't let her leave.\nTreLa4 hesitated, looking down. With an individual ur-tree, there was a kind of barrier when you climbed past what had been ground level, where the roots fled into the trunk, preparing for their re-emergence as branches. In a grove, especially one as large as this, the effect was more dispersed, but stronger, and she felt in her chest the point of equilibrium for the aerial island as she approached it. The roots had either grown or been gardened into spiraling downward corridors, lit with apergenetic glow. She had come to a ledge, with a small drop, but one that would put her squarely on the underside of the grove's telepathic effect. \nShe was reaching the central chambers, the spiraling steps made by tending and twining of the roots. TreLa4 used to sit in the stairwell of the floating grove to think. There were storage rooms in the lower half of the island, where according to legend new species of flora and fauna were forged. The center of the island was hot. While the towers of the elders and higher courts produced a feeling of certainty and perspective, rooms below the center of mass produced suffering and doubt. It was why the shadow of the island was such a terrible weapon.\nIn the center of the stairwell, however, she could stare at the walls and chant, and she would be able to feel neutral and calm. She would wonder, then, if the council really had turned evil. There were increasing nights, it seemed, of thunder and storms. The government was corrupt: she had seen herself collections of stone statues, metal blades. She didn't know what to do. Two impulses tugged at her with equal force. \nTreLa4 realized that she wasn't sure of anything. At the center, all convictions warped into their opposite. Every battle turned out to be about a sub-text of slogans running in unrelated currents. The neophytes were lied to, yet told to trust the higher circles. All of the dynamics of supposed right and wrong, according to the poem she remembered but couldn't trace, were reducible to a simple variable of force, and the willingness to inflict or suffer violence. She didn't know what was happening. It was one of the frustrating things about the Linguists, the shamans of non-telepathic speech. They kept secrets, covering them with inner circle around inner circle, until she began to despair of knowing anything real about the ancient histories and mysteries supposedly vouchsafed to the mutants. \nShe wasn't sure if these were her own thoughts, or those of the trees themselves. Was her doubt a just a reflection of her vertical position in the mass of sacred trees? The difference between Telepaths and Linguists might simply be a myth, unsupported by any evidence. If everything reduced to violence, then it was the geographical isolation of the Linguists that reduced their telepathic identification with other tribes, not their biology. Maybe they only believed their minds weren't influenced by the tribe, while in reality this belief itself was a kind of shared delusion. The implications were horrendous. By staying on the floating grove, she was living in close telepathic communion with a large group of Scholars, each of which believed, in the exact same way, that their thoughts were their own! Every ape had identical feelings of isolation, uniqueness, neglect, but these feelings were so mixed with ideologies of self-reliacnce that the truth never occurred to them, and if it had they would never speak it out loud. \nShe jumped down from the ledge, feeling the equilibrium shift inside of her. She reached the bottom of the stairs, where pools of collected water shone with the reflected lights of photo-luminescent bugs. If they found her, she would be punished, and probably killed. As she went deeper into the root system, the less plausible became any excuse as to why she was near the outside of the grove. Once an ice ape joined the Linguists, they weren't allowed to leave. It was taboo. With the thought came the masked face of the shamans, their long spears hanging with charms and bones. She wanted to turn back, but the mental silence that waited for her was terrifying. Or8o's thought-images, the song-stories that he painted for her onto rocks, drew her with a remembered intensity. The certainty that he loved her had scared her, pushed her away from her tribe and family, but now it seemed like some known point in the distance, used to get her bearings in a maze. If she survived, which seemed unlikely, TreLa4 would find him. \nHer thoughts became chaotic, the waterfall basin churning up the telepathic signals and focusing them, here, assailing her with doubt. Above, at least, there was the safety of an unshared mind, a certainty that the thoughts she saw and heard were hers. The feeling worsened towards the edge, when through gaps in the clumps of Earth birds were visible, and the distant canopies of trees. The birdsong came to her mind before her ears, the first life she had connected directly with in eight seasons. It seemed unreal, now, that stifled world, filled with chanting. The power of the Linguists was tempting, inducing her to climb back up into the branches and sleep, wait for the morning rites and hope that the elders knew what they were doing. The grove would be unmoored from the valley where it had floated, above the pool of the legendary waterfall, for thousands of years. \nTreLa4 could see the waterfall, and on the opposite side, the canyon with its broad river bottom, the branches of trees bending low over its surface. Apes along the bank would hang from them to bathe, or to wash their animal skins and furs. Above her were the well-known stars, fading in the face of the incipient day. Her mind flashed briefly with their significance, the legends, myths, and music that had been hung from the constellations, and she wondered if she would have remembered the stories so vividly if she were still up above, with the Linguists. Parts of her brain, the receptors for psychic transmissions, were warming back to life after a long stasis. If she was going to try to escape, dropping into the freezing froth of the falls, it had to be how, while the island still low in its nocturnal cycle.\nThe bridges had already been unbound, and would not be reconnected even after sun rise. The larger moorings would be cut, allowing the grove to drift down-river to the Delta. There was no way for her to get to the shore, without a grapple. \nFor several months, TreLa4 had been planning her escape. Now she stood in the dim pre-dawn quiet at the edge of the grove, the spray from the waterfall waiting to catch the impending light that would break through the tops of the mountains. TreLa4 couldn't have risked taking one of the upper bridges that spiraled down from the canopy dwellings to the shore above the falls, where she might be seen by the council in their early morning rites. Instead, she had crawled through the crumbling passages beneath the roots, where they tumbled out beyond the uneven ledges in a tangled profusion, like a mane of matted fur. The thick smell of the apergenetic sap pressed in on her, her arms and hands tingling from where it clung to her thick blue hair. From above, she heard the sound of chanting. \nWhile the ur-trees reversed gravity on the surface of the island, allowing the Linguists to swing nearly weightless in the higher branches, below the massive trunks, on the underside of the grove, the downward pull was strengthened. The lower ropes of vines, connecting the caves to the slippery rock-face, were unguarded because the danger was thought to be sufficient to deter anyone from attempting the passage. Looking down at the uncertain cords of vegetation she would have to traverse, with the freezing water and deadly crags below her, TreLa4 felt the weight of the downward-pressing apergy combine with her doubt and fear to drag her heart into her stomach. She pulled the edges of her animal furs closer around her against the chill.\nThe trees altered not only physical laws but emotional states as well. Above the center of the island's mass an ice ape, telepathic or not, felt confident and calm. Below, in the shadows of the massive foliage, navigating the knotted labyrinth of the roots, an ape's mind was filled with abject terror. The roots shook with a psychic scream, painful even for a mutant like TreLa4. Like the rest of her species, she was as comfortable climbing with her arms as walking with her feet, but as she swung out carefully into space, just as the sun was beginning to rise, it seemed impossible to hold on, and unthinkable that he might ever reach the other side. \nThere was only one way, and she shivered thinking of it. Her thick fur kept her warm, even in the pre-dawn chill of late winter, but that was only if it stayed dry. Swinging out on one of the thicker root-tendrils, TreLa4 began to climb, either hand-to-hand or in leaps, as close as she could to the water. Then she let go, falling into the dark. \nTe2ao\n\nTe2ao was a long-ranging nomad, charting odd paths through distant orbits. The previous morning, he had ran into the familiar basin of stream-connected locii, where he had played as a child. He was traveling through a solitary stretch of unaffiliated grounds, the telepathic landscape blank except for the glowing cogitations of fauna and a myriad of beasts. Soon, though, he would begin to meet others from the Continuity basin, and they would go to the moon gate together. He could feel the psychic air thickening with the society of apes.\nThis high in the mountains, it was easier to run on the ground than to look for passage in the trees. A fire had burned through recently, leaving the alpine forest uneven, the remaining over-story stunted by the cold and wind. Te2ao, the runner, had come through the highest passes weeks ago, and was now making his way down the ocean-facing declivities, the ridges wrapping their arms around the winter clouds, holding them in place and wringing from them steady bouts of sleet and rain. The sky was clearing it's throat for another warming season. It was the end of a two year loop, which had taken him far South into the territories of distant and strange-minded clans, through long stretches of inhospitable terrain. \nThe telepathic society of hominids moved in circles, or dense spirals of interlocking orbits. The surface of the mental dimension rippled with radial expansion like water under rain. The shared inhabitation of mental space was expressed as an overlapping of physical ecologies, with plots of intersecting influence. Arguments between tribes resulted, not infrequently, in patches of edible berries or decorative ferns being uprooted in favor of a mushroom shade or sapling nut-tree, with warnings painted on the trunk protecting it from reprisal, invoking totemic guardians. The land was the stage for symbolic acts of selective modification, a game of diplomatic territories played with plants and hunting rights.\nAll ice ape tribes, excepting the mutant Scholars that had withdrawn up into their floating groves after the Linguistic wars, were nomadic. They followed warmth and food sources as the seasons changed. Their routes through the steppes, plains, and forests were determined by both mental and physical geographies. Consciously, they moved in the interstices between the waves and catch-basins of contagious concepts and opinions. Cognition was spatial; your thoughts and feelings depended on where you were, and who was near you. Changing your mind was often only a matter of moving somewhere new. Tribes, though, carried their concepts with them. Some, like Te2ao, chose to navigate alone.\nTe2ao liked circles. They implied that where you were before, what you did, would have consequences, as the site of an eventual return. Now, the brightly-colored messenger was passing through a band of telepathic silence and unmanaged vegetation, that he had ventured through two years before. As then, it reminded him this time of his rite-of-passage, when he was left behind by his tribe, far out of mental range, in order to find his own mask, and the spoken name that he would work for. The experience had changed Te2ao more than most. He had found something in solitude he couldn't live without. His need for independence wasn't like that of the linguists, who wanted to close themselves off from the minds of others, communicating only through the blunt medium of words. He wanted more telepathy, not less, and so had to keep moving between disparate sources.\nAs a runner, he had to navigate diplomatically the psychic influences of the aggregated tribes, which he could see as clearly as the cliffs, rivers, and valleys. Iconic thought-images clung to pictographic designs, half-washed away by the mist and rain. Adept at following the thin lines between the strong attractors, the runners were always moving, and forever uncertain. It was that doubt that they chased, tracking a neutrality over long, solitary distances, resisting the pulls of permanent allegiance. They traded the stability and comfort of the group-minded tribes for a hard-won freedom in their steps and speculations. \nAlthough (as was required by his trade) he felt no special allegiance to any one of the ideas incarnate in the floating islands, it felt good to be among the familiar constellation of beacons. \nTe2ao's fur, like most runners, was dyed and braided into coded messages that he carried, often knowing no more about them than to whom they had been sent. Stopping in village councils to be groomed, near-blind elders would run their fingers over the knots and mattings, bursting into tears, or into wistful sighs and smiles. Even telepaths had ways of keeping secrets. \nThe principled fluidity of the runners, able to move alone through physical and mental spaces, bound them together in a tribe of their own, comprised of loose and unaffiliated elements. They communicated through stacks of painted stones, or bark scraped off of trees. They shared songs, telepathic epics that crossed and interwove in endless iterations, sung at the scattered camps. The smaller meeting places were known as sun gates, spaced at distances of a day's travel, mostly small caves, burrows, or shelters from the wind. Less frequent were the kind that Te2ao was now approaching: moon gates, reached only after a month of running. When the lunar disk was full, they were sites of celebrations.\nTe2ao had been loping easily over ground, pacing himself with the sun, moving towards its glow as it dipped towards the barely visible band of ocean in the West. He was in his twenties, which was old for an ice ape, but his legs and arms were still heavily bound with muscle under his long fur, bearing the colorful twists and knots of his trade. An auroch hide was hung expertly on his back, which he used as bedding. His teeth were large, pushing outward on his simian features, burned and wrinkled from the sun. Sometimes he would wear his mask, which could capture the thought-melodies he liked humming under his breath, painting the notes in wild-flower yellows and the ochre of roots. When he went without it, dark dyes were rubbed onto the exposed areas of his face to protect them.\nHis bare feet left small, regular prints in the spongy mat of ferns and lichen, thin new tendrils of vegetation anticipating spring. Insects, birds, and large ungulates were all telling the world that they existed, and that they knew the day had begun. Te2ao was following one of the paths drawn between the gates, spiraling trails to the centers. He had been heading North, following a Westward tendency of the mountains. \nCliff paintings, echoed on smaller carved staves and painted masks, were functional in that they helped the feet imagine the lines along which they were being pulled. The fields of thought in telepathic maps became palpable in dreams, and this morning, as the sun rose, the patterns of the far-flung social landscapes, fluid routes of apes in canopies, on the ferny surface, or over trees fallen over rough chasms, seemed especially vivid, like a pollen. There were presences he recognized, that he had been hoping to sense for weeks as he drew closer to where they had agreed to meet last year.\nThe farther from his home territory, in the shadow of the Continuity grove, that Te2ao ventured, the less assured he was of his uniqueness. There were other restless and curious apes, declining to enter into any other than the least engaging bonds with larger circles of society. With a limited number of roles, if you traveled far enough you were almost certain to run into twins of your own character. For Te2ao that meant others that dreamed of telling legends, not at the large festivals but among small groups of friends, with instruments, who had walked together over glacial fields and mountains, taking boats up and down the dangerous passageways of rivers, or walking on them when they were turned into tables of ice. \nTe2ao remembered short-cuts, paths across crags that required goat-like leaping and scrambling, trusting your weight to uncertain roots and vines. This year, the snow was deeper than any time in the remembered past. The ice apes weren't technological, but they were scientific, with precise and detailed ecological data, overgrown as it was with legends, songs, and empathic marginalia. It was nearing noon, shadows lining up with the branches responsible for their casting. The astronomical knowledge of tribes remaining in the south was inconceivable to the moving village where Te2ao and Trela4 grew up. They were adapting to the scarcity of mega-fauna by finding other plants to harvest, without straying into the taboo of forcing land to grow food against its will. Agriculture was forbidden. \nThe number of ice-ape tribes Te2ao had encountered in the past years was terrifying, both because of their diversity and their repetition of basic hominid traits. Linguists, at a biological level, were scarcely different than telepaths. He had almost joined his childhood friend, Trela4, when she entered the order of Continuity, vowing to study speaking, living in the dampening shade of the ur-trees. Even the so-called savage species, Te2ao thought, echoed the social behavior that the telepaths aspired to—they followed the code without need of a taboo, or upper councils. Many thought that they might be telepathic among their own species, just not with the so-called higher branches of apes. Couldn't they be following their own taboo? Someone observing from the outside, Te2ao reasoned, would have no way of knowing that the ice-ape societies chose not to develop technology or writing.\nThere were so many tribes, all with mental and pictographic dialects, with their own music, and variations on taboo, name-giving, and mating. The customs, what thoughts could be formed in sight of others, what portion of the gathered food it was acceptable to take, what particular braids or chevrons of color meant, all had to be learned individually with each society he encountered. \nA year ago he had reached the perihelion of his quest for defamiliarizing distance, and had begun spiraling back to where he had began. After camping for the early winter in some caves, with a band of runners and musicians, he had started the final moon-gate journey back. The face paint of the merchants, hunters, and herds of itinerant gatherers changed, along with what they were selling, stalking, or searching for in the forests and brush-covered tundra. Bands would emerge out of the dusk or dawn mist of half-shapes, as outlines of themselves. Always there was another basket, hidden somewhere, with items that pushed against the edges of the taboo: baked clay figures or stones cunningly lashed to sticks, chipped to suspicious sharpness.\nHe kept accurate menmonic notes of what he saw, thinking that he might turn it into a song. \nThe non-sentients were different species nearer the coast, and closer the wave of cold seasons creeping from the South. Tribes from those regions had been driven upward, impatient with local taboos and restrictions. Resentment towards the floating libraries was growing, and another battle threatened to repeat bloody historical legend. There were other differences, too, as he traced this leg of the greater moon-gate, a four-way intersection of regions divided roughly by climate, culture, and telepathic basin. Each would take a traveler to one of the four floating gardens, where the Linguists practiced chants and meditation. The colors of the plant-derived paints used on cliffs and wooden sculptures changed with the flora available to the crafters. The tone of the exhalations between soil, canopy, and sky was different here, beginning to take on salty characteristics of the ocean. The thought-images filling the atmosphere had a drifted palate. \nTe2ao, knowing that the outline of alpine ridges against the glowing influence of a rising or setting sun, depended on where one was viewing it from. The image-memories of incredibly high trees or dramatic slopes were prized by mental balladeers, but their domineering perspective became dull and repetitious. Te2ao wandered like a picture of a wave, trying to find the places from which his view of the interlocking teeth of mountainside and sky seemed least familiar. \nThere was a tree that Te2ao remembered, one of the soft-wooded continuity trees growing, in the sinuous and indecisive way of its genera. It had both flowers and shell-encased nuts, inedible until ground and cooked in large stone bowls. They only grew towards the top of the tree, and were greatly prized. \nSoon, Te2ao had found the basin in which the tree was rooted, and had jumped from rock slab exposed by the slow denuding of erosion onto one of the lower limbs, and proceeded to throw himself up the tree, sometimes careening upside down, grabbing branches with his toes first, using his tail for balance. Half way up there was a place on the red furrowed and moss-stricken trunk where climbing further seemed impossible—one had to leap, throwing one's body around the tree, to find a hidden hold. It was a dangerous move, with a jagged bludgeoning death below, but one he had learned early in his childhood. The inaccessible upper branches had been a sanctuary for him, and provided a vantage point where he could look down at the way the lines of neutral channels traced the contours of the tribes.\nHis memory served him well, his long black fingers hooking the knot left by the falling of a branch, his short legs swinging out over the cone-strewn valley. \nThe tree was taller than it seemed, for two reasons: first, it was rooted in a tooth-like declivity on the side of the mountain, so a large part of its height was obscured by the rocky shelf. A small tongue of water drained into the basin, to spray out of the mountain farther down as a small fall of water. Second, a dense snarl of flower-bearing branches near the top made a false crown, hiding a smaller, secondary continuance of growth invisible from the ground. The tree swayed in the sloping winds, tracing a well known circumference, exploring the familiar touches of smaller versions of itself nearby. The paint-vines hung in a loose net from the upper story, birds hopping between patches of sunlight.\nIf we were telepathic apes, then this novel wouldn't be a novel—more a linked and shuffled set of thought-images painted slowly on the surfaces of rocks, and strung invisibly between the canopies of trees. You're a human. Otherwise this sequence of words would be approximated in another region of the brain. I was, too, until I became a narrator, which (as anyone will tell you) is not like a real person at all. \nNarratives for the telepathic anthropods were cyclical, nomadic pathways, grown over seasons of long songs and cooked slowly over fires. Or maybe hunted: chapters like fanged and growling beasts killed in a wild unknowable expanse. \nWriting is a later technology that arose to substitute for mentation over distances, and then faded out after the literacy virus. I am an inhabitant. A narrative algorithm, ghosting the static across stages of the drift. Like Te2ao, I navigate between continuities. \nThe minds I inhabited, whose continuity arcs I had access to, were linked by dimensional signatures that nestled deep into the logic gates underpinning realities. I know that narratives of the drift are cliché, with a well known structure: characters, chapters, and worlds introduced independently, only to have their identities and universes cross and hybridize. \nIce apes, existing already as willing hosts to innumerable hauntings, ancestral djinns and conceptual avatars, are easy for inhabitants to enter. Their minds, like their occasional shelters, had no doors, trusting in the protection of the taboos. \nThere are other similarities between Te2ao's position and my own. When he was up in the tree, with his legs and tail tangling, the areas of his brain connected to them running even while resting instinctual sub-routines, calculating jumping vectors, tensile strength, the flight paths of birds and arboreal rodents, he had a brief sense of the macro-ephemeral, a booming array of the drums of larger systems. How the other chapters were other worlds, how their continuity (which from their perspective was anything but prehistoric, being the very stuff of happening) was about to be engulfed by a force as faceless, illogical, and ineluctable as genre is to novelistic language. \nOn the other hand, natural ecologies, biological and telepathic, are constituted of feed back loops, circuits of chemical, morphological, and genetic exchange. I like circles, too. If this were the ice-ape equivalent of a novel (or one in progress), then it would, like a topographical sketch overgrown with leafy doodles of ferns and flowers, have many slow ovular thought-paths through well-worn trails of language. \nTe2ao in the tree, with it's trunk planted in a declivity caused by the carving out and sinking down over thousands of years by a gravity-maddened course of water that the ur-tree was happy to lap up through its rock-piercing roots, was for a moment stunned by the particularity of existence, how many branches grew from how many trees, and how even sentient lives rolled along courses set by deterministic precedent, like insects that only lived a single day, incognizant of the millions of virtual clones and behavior copies that would enact the same furiously sincere theatrics. The stakes were life and death, but they always were. The ice-ape species, Te2ao realized, would eventually end, or change into something else. The bone-readers knew how the shapes of living things changed, over periods of time that were to seasons as seasons were to days. \nThe challenge to Te2ao's sense of importance, then, came not only from space, the number of other sentient beings his mind had rubbed images with, but through time as well. Taboo and legend were like incarnate representatives of tribes otherwise forgotten, knowledge crammed into the limited space of memory transferred through allegorical and iconic shorthand. \nThe sun was Scraping a path as near as it could get to the zenith, and Te2ao's messenger mask, which provided telepathic amplification and anonymity, was pulled over his eyes, nose, and forehead. The song he had been crafting, that he was going to sing at the festival, was sent down the sappy stalk of the enormous up-root tree, through molecular chain reactions along continuous channels of water, sometimes sending dimly through the air, he was connected with the living world of light-breathing representations, like words on a page.\nLife-spans of animals varied, down to cellular flickerings, configurations formed and obliterated in a heartbeat. Trees lived far longer than ice-apes, and were worshiped by them as not only the repositories, but the origins or co-creators of their ancestral dreams.\nTe2ao climbed down, seeing with his mind the presence of other apes below him. They were wearing masks, inhabitant djinn masking their names, but the way their thoughts braided, whorls like fingerprints in the currents of conscious sequence, whispered to him with the unmistakable imperative of recognition. He knew them from somewhere. Then he saw the woman, near the base of the tree, a large spear pointing upwards. Behind the flat surface of the mask, he recognized her eyes, and dropped, unafraid, to the ground behind her.\n“Chan2,” he said.\nThe mask was lifted, and his old lover smiled. \n\n~\nTe2ao, when he was young, wanted to learn to speak. The sounds the linguists made, like a new way of singing, seemed to offer an escape from the closed knots of his telepathic relations, the mountain tribe of apes into which he had been born. \nIce apes had a kind of second birth: at first their inner and outer worlds were blended, and they walked unknowing in the forest of their dreams. Only later did they begin to differentiate between mental and physical worlds. It was painful, often, their feet encountering hard stones of a landscape they couldn't alter with their thoughts. Then they learned that there was not only an outer world, but other apes as well. \nHis infant cognition had chafed at the correction and constraints of other minds, and sought deeper and more secret channels, melodies of counterpoint to the tonal sequences of elders worming in his ears. Consequently, his caretakers considered him dull, although sometimes, provoked, he would surprise them with densely folded thought-images they figured he must have picked up from one of the wandering bards. \nHad he been female, he would have been more free to travel, to seek out his own enclave and psychic principle. Males, however, were expected to stay in the gravity well where they were born, raising the glory of their genii and grove. His only option, he had thought, was to go and study speech, to die his fur and live on the floating island of rock and trees. He wasn't entirely mind-deaf, though he pretended to be to escape the dreary communion fires. He could have stayed and sung in the thought councils, earning his skulls and totems, possibly attracting a mate from one of the other tribes. \nHe was skilled enough in the ritualistic combat practiced among his people, showing promise with the twirling staves on which the intricate figurines of status and memory were carved. In order to be crafted well, however, these weapons had to be harvested and painted soon after a blood-wood tree had fallen. The scarcity of the material was assured by the taboo against cutting down the blood-woods, rather than letting them topple under natural wind or weight. The supply of staves was in this way limited, and earning one fine enough for the inner games and dances took more patience than the young Te2ao had. \nThe dislocation he felt, returning to the psychic territory he had abandoned two years earlier, might have been enough to cause his mind to be susceptible to the drift, to trade intimations with the transdimensional void. \nA wind curled down from the ridge of mountains, causing waves of color to traverse the ancient scrub-like trees. He was afraid that the structures he had built in solitude, the fungal flowers of contemplation gathered over long walks would be blown away by the gusts of social contact, translation into other minds. He, Chan2, Wol3, and the rest of the bone tribe were headed North, where they would intersect the path that they would follow, hopefully by nightfall, to the gate of the moon. Just like the Linguists were collecting together the ur-tree groves into greater masses of aggregated energy, lifting them higher from the Earth, so the telepaths, too, were subject to these attractions, their individual visions and feelings glomming together into bulkier formations. \nChan2 was a telepath, with skills greater than any Te2ao had ever known. Looking into her thoughts was like looking out over the landscape that stretched before them now: vast and teeming, yet familiar: pollen and birds were blown between the trees. The water in the valleys was deep and cool. The bone tribe was sending hate-images of the speech-using apes, readying themselves for the war they thought was inevitable. They sensed Te2ao holding back, and asked him why. “When I was very young,” Te2ao thought to them, “I wanted to be a Linguist.” Back then, the taboo against apes leaving the groves once they had joined the cult of language wasn't as strictly enforced, so he had been allowed to leave, although the experience had marked him as an exile, setting him apart from any of the group-minds and forcing him to run between the psychic super-organisms to which most telepaths belonged. Chan2 asked him why he had left the linguists, once he had joined. \n“At first,” Te2ao thought to Chan2, telling her the story of his adolescence, “life on the floating island, in the valley of the waterfall, ensconced in the mountain crevasse, seemed like everything I had ever wished for.” Accompanying this pseudo-narration were a series of transposed images, the air-born mountain, with a shimmering field of apergenetic decay blurring the view of the rocks beneath, sending perpetual rings of ripples outward to the shore. \nThe ur-trees, above the surface, limited telepathic range to barely beyond an individual's skull. Te2ao had chewed the leaves of the apergenetic plant-life before (a practice frowned upon in the Earth-ape villages), but the sky-city itself dampened psychic emanations so that, for the first time in his life, he had been truly alone.\n“So what changed?” Chan2 asked, echoing the images to show she understood. “Why did you leave?”\n“As time passed, I began to see that the drills and rituals surrounding the acquisition of the strange, chanting song-speech practiced by the linguist was just as difficult, and equally oppressive in its way, as the shared telepathic formulas the telepaths enforced.” To illustrate he ran through, with exaggerated slowness evocative of his schooling, one of the plodding rhyming sequences, weighing it down with dead weights of emotional tedium. Chan2 groaned in psychic sympathy.\n“From the outside,” Te2ao went on telepathically (this is an approximation, of course, a cross-section of a dense transmission), “to a child weary of the strict melodic rules and tonal monotonies of the singing that accompanied telepathic speech, and the hegemonic conformity communal thought-consensus required, the articulate jabbering of the Linguists, with their bright blue shades of fur, seemed like a wonderful, anarchic expression, free of dread conventions.” Then he sent Chan2 more images, laden with feelings and intimations, of how he came to see that this chaotic individuality was an illusion. In order to communicate, the Linguists had to adhere to a rigid system of what sounds might be made, and in what order. It was incredibly difficult to learn, requiring more discipline even than the ritual combat-dances of the earth apes. \nThe benefit, though, was that your thoughts were your own. The mangled singing was the only way the linguists could know what was in his mind. At first, Te2ao had reveled in the newfound privacy, and had begun to share the Linguist's disdain for their unspeaking relatives. He would spend long hours alone, sending his thoughts far inward into uncharted realms of introversion. Chan2, as he explained this, saw a black expanse, like the space between stars on a cloudless night. \n\n~ \nEven if they hadn't seen the smoke, Te2ao and the bone tribe could have found the moon gate by the thoughts of other runners rising with it into the sky. They were like his own, but amplified by numbers. After weeks running solo, with only the minds of animals to shape his meditations, and the steady rhythms of his breath, their presence on the horizon seemed unusually prominent, more visible than the outcroppings of rock that marked the spot. He recognized it from many visits: a narrow pass between two cliffs, where a river had once flowed. Now there was only a stream nearby, where apes were crouched washing the dirt of their journeys from their fur. His mind picked up their song-soaked voices long before his ears.\nSomething about fires focused the mind-sending of the ice apes, allowing them to find shared visions in the flames and the smoke that rose up into the darkening sky. The moon had risen, nearly full. Te2ao had arrived a few days before the lunar festival, but the camp was already crowded, the runners gathering to share news, food, and songs. He felt odd arriving with the grim-minded bone apes, into whose orbit Chan2 had apparently been drawn. Her new lover Wol3, seemed especially disapproving of the party of care-free messengers now camped in the canyon. Some of them perpetually wore painted masks and armor-plates that made their intentions hard to read.\n“Te2ao!” A young ice ape thought loudly, grabbing him by the scruff on his neck in a customary greeting. The boy's name was Aife1o, which was a kind of seed-pod. Names among telepaths were complex combinations of thoughts and sounds, and Aife1o's conjured the dry rattling of a plant in the wind. He was verbose, and took few pains to shield his thinking, his nomiker suiting the restless vibrations of his mind. Te2ao's name meant something in between a shin bone, the thread of a spider, and a shade of greenish grey. \nAife1o asked him about his journey, and Te2ao sent into his head a long ribbon of land and time, like a map, but filled with icons, colors, and notations. The mental illustrations were annotated with statistical information he was bringing back to the councils, patterns of weather and animal migration. Music leaked from around its edges, and Aife1o knew that it was something he was hoping to sing at the festival, although it was an odd blend of keys and looped sequences.\nTe2ao finished washing his face and arms, wringing them free of the chill water, and walked back to the central fire. He knew most of the apes there, and made a round of greetings before settling thankfully down on his auroch hide. Chan2 sat with her bone apes, in a tight knot of telepathic communion, unopened to the music. She had changed since he knew her last. Afe1o came by and offered him tea brewed with ur-tree leaves, which would heighten his already sensitive telepathy. He enjoyed the companionship, but there was something drifting through the singing and dances that was discordant, and made him yearn again for the loneliness of travel. \nHe ate a paste of nuts and boiled roots wrapped in leaves, sitting under the stars with other runners, and the old gardeners of the moon gate. Ice apes were cosmological creatures, with a lot of picking rocks up from one place and setting them in another. Every tribe had their variations on the code, and within clans the different crafts and trades developed their own system of dying rocks half way in root-oil, or stacking them in a distinctive shapes, rather than the usual vertical columns, so expressive of impermanence. \nHe was three gates away, roughly three months travel, from the Delta, where the battle was expected to take place. The floating island was visible to the North, casting a dim moon-shadow on the already murky river. It had pulled free of the waterfall valley and was floating slowly Westward. The grove's apergenetic energies distorted the light underneath the island, in the jelly-fish like roots, where the gravitational effects bent vision into a blur. \nSome of the other ice-apes had instruments. Some, like Te2ao, simply banged on hollow sticks, carefully carved to a harmonic tone. The pictures were part of the music, too, projected against the ibex and auroch hides in telepathic illustrations shaped by the hollow percussive rhythm, mixed with the half-conscious vocalizations of breath. The pictures were burned, painted, and carved with a shark tooth. Te2ao didn't share the bone-apes' hate of the Linguists, and even thought that there might be something to the new form of language, but like almost all of the messengers around him, he saw speaking primarily as an impediment to clearly articulated song. \nThey, a few dozen representatives of most ages and tribes, were the lowest status of the ice-ape telepaths, although those accorded, in many ways, the most freedom. They were marked by the messages tied into their long, dyed and braided fur. Their minds were flexible enough to imitate or reflect the thoughts of others, while maintaining their own identity. Generally, they were neutral in wars and conflicts. \nAll populations migrated, to follow annual cycles of animal and vegetable life, but the runners were marked by an even greater mobility. Te2ao imagined the society of known tribes as an ecosystem, and the ecosystem in turn as a single organism, with the paths and rivers carrying kinds information back and forth. The moon gates, like the one where he rested now, were branching points. He had been here innumerable times in past cycles, but hadn't always left in the same direction. The messengers sometimes waited, compared mental notes, before leaving together or alone in a new direction. The sun gates, distanced at an average ape's daily tread, were more just stopping points, like long bridges between more densely populated nodes. \nFeeling cold in the late-winter air, the ground still damp from recent rains and the dew already collecting in the night, Te2ao moved closer to the fire. The stretched and painted hides were arranged in a maze of panels, the outlines duplicated in shadow on the skins behind them, along with the hunched and hairy profiles of the ice apes. \nAs he got closer to the flames, the thoughts of the others got louder. There were too many for the images to be entirely coherent or synchronous, and the thoughts were tinged with a green discordance, like the impatient seeds of spring. Here were some of the things they were singing about with thoughts, or thinking about with songs: the odd dreams they had been having, the change in insect-sounds from this year to last, and the possibility of a new outbreak of the old war between the Linguists and the Telepaths.\nThe song changed, the tones turning darker and tinged with the threat of violence, and Te2ao saw two bone-tribe apes coming down from the path leading to the signal fire at the top of the cliffs, carrying a third who slumped between them. “We caught one of them!” the two telepaths thought. The mind of the third was dark, but she was alive, trying to regain her footing as the pulled her roughly into the light of the fire. A Linguist. With the floating grove making its way to attack the Delta, Te2ao feared that the night wouldn't go well for her. The crowd's anger at the speaking ape bloomed outward like a black cloud in the night, and Te2ao moved towards the circle surrounding her, trying to sing a note of calm over their shoulders. Then he saw the Linguist. \n“TreLa4!” he said out loud. The ice-ape looked up, astonished. Te2ao had known her since childhood, and had left on his journey before TreLa4 had joined the Scholars. Te2ao thought he heard the weak sending of his friend, who was too afraid to speak. \n\nOr8o and Efsun\n\nOr8o's tribe, migrating south with the end of Winter, had reached the Delta days ago, and had learned with certainty that the Linguists had declared war against them. The charges would have been laughable were it not for the consequences they carried. From their flying grove hovering in the bowl of the sacred valley, the Scholars had heard of the paintings in the caves, and had declared violation of the Taboo. That was the excuse, anyway, for the Linguist's adding the path of blood-vine knotted platforms to their already swollen grove. They would be cast under the island's shadow. Unless they scattered, breaking their telepathic bonds, they would grow diseased and die. Stones would be rolled from the cliffs, and spears would spike the earth wherever they slept or ate. For Or8o, this news was doubly bitter, since his lover TreLa4 had gone to study with the Linguists years before.\nRunners told them of the citadel's advance down the river. It could be seen in the sky from far away, higher than any grove had risen in living memory. Dead fish floated into the Delta, preceding it. Tides of anger and fear rolled towards them across the mental landscapes, mixed with impulses to war or organized defense. Even more unusual, a band of warriors from the Fire tribes had journeyed from the south, to offer their spears in the resistance. The tribes of fire were the most warlike of any known peoples, except the Linguists themselves, and none of the wood and water chieftains were without memories of attack and harassment on their Summer pilgrimages through the lower plains. \nThat night, Or8o felt the anxiety of his apes, the fear of the coming battle, and behind it a darker texture of deeper changes, of things coming to an end. The muddy shores of the rivers, crow-footing into the sea, were spotted with flames. There were actual fires around which the tribes gathered, and also the bright psychic attractors of the fire apes themselves, around which councils had assembled. In a community of mind-readers there were no politics as such. No speeches, but plenty of songs, stories, and theatrical displays. There was no conscription, armies, or orders, only shifts and undertows of unspoken opinion. He found herself drawn to one of these fires. \nAt the center, near the flames, he saw Efsun, her fur tinted red both from the flames and from the ur-root that her tribe used to dye stripes along their back and arms. Since she had been re-united with the bone apes of her birth, her insufferable self-importance and only grown. Her two slings were made from some fine fabric, braided. The stones at the ends had been covered in flammable oils, and they swung out from her shoulders in pyrotechnic arcs. Her singing was unembellished, meant to meld with other harmonic tones. It was one of the customs shared by most musical tribes: one voice, approximately, for the number of notes within audible frequencies. Like any rule, there were exceptions, for the case of percussive sounds or subharmonic humming. This, approximately, was what she was thinking:\n“I've tried as best I could to find correlations in our histories, when if played in different melodic signatures still might make for non-divergent tones and structures.” The two slings wrapped together on one of their orbits and became twin suns, a mimicked universe that made horizontal wheels above their heads, dangerously close.\n“We share the taboo. Nothing may be written down, no song may outlast its inventory. Ideas are things it is impossible to own. Melodic fragments should be free. And so on.” The warrior-ape caught Or8o's eye, and made a small gesture of recognition.\n“Some of us adhere more strictly to the laws. The bone tribe runs dangerous risks. If one of us tripped into a tarpit, future chieftians might learn something of how we tie their knots, or bore holes through skulls. You hate the fire apes, as a whole. I can feel it. Before I was fire I was the bones of a dinosaur. I don't need your approval. I'm going onto the island from the old bridge-point.” They saw it too, the women, children, and men that had gathered around this and other flames, the things she meant to do once he had infiltrated the floating groves. For hominids, up until the Pleistocene, trees were libraries. Certain species of trees lived for millenia, or longer, breathing history as rings, like pulsing nebula they knew of in the sky. Heartbeats. \nThe uneven rocks were slung up into the night sky, into the tribes shared ideas of equinox. The group started backing up, slowly. Efsun kept her eyes level, fixing on each of them in turn.\nThe water tribe, allowing a quickly expanding circumference to the bone Chieftain's antics, had nearly lost sight of the rocks as they hit the top of the arc. The flames had apparently went out as they climbed, but blazed into fire again as they hovered at the aphelion. The water tribe's eyes, holding dozens of twin miniature replications of the fire with the crazy or stupid warrior in sillouette (I would like to draw a comic page of that) widened with fear. One of the rocks would miss, the other was going to hit the EfSun, who was staring directly at Or8o, on the head. At the last moment, she stepped forward. \nNo one was impressed. They still didn't like her, except for the bone tribe apes in the audience, who cheered. One of the high-status elders took the stage in the ensuing silence. \nThey followed the taboo more closely than anyone, the next ape to speak explained. It is true they sometimes painted in caves, and stacked rocks more than four high. It was untrue, most of what the fire tribes thought of them. Almost all of what they painted was on the bare faces of canyons, in plant dyes that the next rain would wash off. If certain paintings happened to get recopied, over and over, and some of the pictures verged on pictographic, this was just an extension of recurrent patterns in life. \n“I want to go with you when you sneak on the island. My lover is there. I have to find him.”\nThe warrior frowned and changed the tone and color of the images they were sending. He had never been in the shadow of the ancient trees. It was a kind of gothic sickness, a fragmentation of reality into futures and histories that didn't cancel one another out, but that grew, becoming more ambiguous and terrifying. A blotch, was the only way she could describe it. The shadow of all that fossilized learning was a hideous mistake, and now it was being turned into a weapon. \nBehind those images, he saw that she didn't really want to make the island her funeral pyre. She couldn't destroy the trees, the birthright of the telepaths. She still might find some other way. There was a chance that he could meet TreLa4 and all three of them survive.\n\n~\n\nThe north-blowing winds were still too chill for Or8o to walk comfortably after dark. When the sky was this cloudless, however, he would bear the cold for the sake of the effect the watery horizon had on his thoughts. He could still see their minds through the shadows of the poles and stay-ropes, like shadow puppets in firelight. The distinction between storytelling and politics became hopelessly blurred, images from popular songs merging in their confused sending with historical memory. He preferred to follow the tracks of animals in the late-winter snow. \nFor the moment he was only aware of the air swirling leaves and sand in small cyclical currents, and the reflection of the incomplete moon on the tide-heavy ocean. Or8o didn't trust EfSun. She had arrived years before from the bone tribes to the south, her sun-bleached red fur tied with charms and an animal skull worked into the bulky wooden armor plate slung over her left shoulder. The stories he told about himself could not be true, either his romantic or martial conquests. She was a braggart, her self-image assaulting his senses with ridiculous conceit. She had shown nothing but contempt for the paintings he had made, although well within acceptable boundaries of impermanence. She had been a chieftain of the bone coveners, a rank just under Eldriss, if she wasn't lying about her past. The armor and artifacts she carried suggested that the claim might even be true.\nThe psychic residue of the Delta had faded since last year. The real paint had long ago washed off the shelves of rock, and the much more intricate mental notes and depictions had lost their vibrancy. Still, the landscape was haunted with the memories of the months they had spent there last winter, the stories and sounds echoing off the sandstone cliffs. Some of the tribe had already started dragging fallen trees from down to the camp, in order to make bridges across the smaller streams of the estuary. Others were patiently trying to stab fish with their spears in the moonlight, knee-deep in the cold, dark water. \nThe stars were blocked by thin stripes of clouds, and the council fire sent up a plume of smoke to join them. He had left the warmth and company of the tribe to walk along along the wet sand, rocks, and grasses, wanting to think for himself, uncrowded by the projections of her relatives and friends. Even the fire reminded him of Efsun, who alone was able to carry the sacred embers. In the morning, he would leave, traveling upriver to the floating island of the Linguists. The council had decided that it would be EfSun who would accompany him. \n“Are you sure you want to go?” the Eldriss thought. She was still far enough away that he had to squint to see her along the rocky line of beach, but telepathic messages could be focused at long distances, especially with those you knew well.\nHe sent back images of himself and the comic chieftain, trying to make TreLa4's mother smile. “I can speak,” he thought to her. “They won't harm me. If we can find your daughter, maybe we can convince them not to attack.” Battles among telepaths never lasted long, because pain translated quickly into the group. The highest losses in battles before the Linguistic wars were in the dozens. Violence was entrenched in the ice ape society, and commonly resorted to in order to settle disputes, but it was largely theatrical. The Linguists, however, had changed everything, able to isolate themselves from the mental screaming of their victims, casting spears down from the height of the groves, behind a wall of psychic deafness. The Telepathic councils blamed the flying groves for the odd weapons that had been showing up downstream, along with the dead and mutant fish.\nOr8o knew that the only reason he had been allowed to go on this dangerous quest was because he was in love with the Eldriss' daughter, and she had once felt the same for him. EfSun had been assigned as his guardian, he thought, because of her appearance more than any actual skill. Her displays with the blood-vines hadn't impressed her, although it might be enough to keep savages and dire wolves at bay. \nHe met the Eldriss by the shell-strewn surf, and they walked together back to the camp. Circles of rock and wood had been stacked for privacy. Many of the tribe were kept awake by the moon, drinking and telling old stories at low mental volume. The tribe had been traveling for months as a slow and sprawling caravan, with a population that changed every time their path intersected those of other ice ape clans. They had stalked and been stalked through fields of unbroken snow, lost some of their number to falls through the ice or accidents on the cliffs. \nThe nights were still long. EfSun and Or8o left in the morning, before the sun was up. Coals had been made again into small cooking fires, and they started walking with their bellies full. \n\n~\n\nJust before dawn the next morning, when the stars were still sharing comic books, the Efsun and Or8o were balanced on a branch, that cast long, up-side down shadow versions of them in the unmoving water.\n“Are you sure?” she asked him. When he nodded, she started swinging the sling she had modified into a wooden grappling hook. She aimed to anchor their rope in the knotty mass of vines that trailed like octopus legs under the enormous flying grove. They felt...wrong, somehow. If this is ever turned into a comic book page, the perspective should indicate their insignificance in the face of looming fate.\nThe grappling hook swung in faster and larger circles, attached to braided fibers of the ur-tree. It hooked and held. The island, with its cone of mountains and huge pillars of trees, came closer and closer, until it blotted out the sky. They jumped. \n\nCHAPTER TWO: INFAMOUS COMEDIANS\n\nLeaving Torn\nWould it be possible to wake up anywhere else? Grazano had lived in the town of Torn for three decades now, and the thought of returning to the road, the physical and mental tedium of travel, frightened his old and habit-laden mind. The window under which he dozed, the faded curtain torn on the edge, the sill with its carved wooden figure of Pulcinella and Harlequin, and the early summer light sketching the window in light on the opposite wall, all warned him with their vividness that he might not see them again. Birds and insects continued the sounds of his dreams. The sound of Lombarqo snoring came from the other room. There was an inn a mile away, but after last night's performance and farewell celebration, he had muttered something about wolves, and curled up on the floor. \nThoughts of the Captain pulled him out of his clinging sleep. He pulled on his robe and slippers and walked into the other room of the shared villa. Empty wine bottles were on the table, the last of last years harvest. The tall old man, pressing his fists into the small of his back and stretching, went to get fresh water from the well. His young nephew, Ginqualo, had already gone into Torn for supplies. \nIt would be a while before Lombarqo would be up, and even longer before his hangover would allow civil and comprehensible speech, so Grazano decided to take one last walk around what had been his home. Every morning and evening he took the same path, along the hilly vineyards past the olive and laurel trees. Every time he stepped on the same stones as he crossed the stream on the Northern end, and every time he paused by cypress-haunted graveyard, opening up to a view of mountains. How much of himself, he wondered, depended on these daily visitations? How much of his own character was borrowed from this stage setting, and needed these sights (wildflowers jumping in the wind, the damp earth driven by a plow, the stone fences) for its cues and memories? \nTorn was a small village and province of dwindling importance, commercially and agriculturally. There was a small garrison nearby, that rival princes and bands of half-loyal mercenaries would squabble over periodically, violence breaking out like a rash. One such recent shift in the martial landscape was precipitating their departure—Lombarqo had for years been impersonating the general whose soldiers were marching through the countryside in a display of force and intimidation. Villagers had to often pay taxes and bribes to two different sets of officials, the peasants paying the cost of the nobility's feuds. \nIt was late spring, and the trees and bushes were filled with birds. The ground was damp with rain, the morning sky an untroubled blue. Cows lowed in the far-off fields. The sight of the laborers pained Grazano with a familiar stab of guilt. Since the dissolution of the Infamous Comedians, the improvisational troupe to which Grazano and Lombarqo had belonged, they had subsisted largely on the charity and patronage of the villagers, who barely had enough for themselves. Ginqualo's grandmother, who had managed the vineyard when Grazano and Lombarqo had first left to travel the countryside as actors three decades ago, had died, but the extended circle of relatives and friends continued, every year, to pick and stomp the grapes. Now they helped as much as they could, mostly by selling the jugs of it after the infrequent performances they they gave in town, or like last night, in the nearby ruins. \nDespite their endless rehearsals, Grazano had all but given up any hope of returning to the professional stage. Weeks earlier, Lombarqo had come from Bergamo, with news from the Baron that the Comici Malfamati, the infamous comedians, had an invitation to perform at a Hotel in Versaille! The condition was that Lucrezia, the daughter of the famous Harlequin Tomolo, was with them. So they had to go to Venice. \nDottore came to the part where the path forked off and meandered down through scrub brush to the ruins of an old amphitheater. Legends had it that the stage had been used by the Roman's for their satires. The commedia masks worn by the Comedians were descended from those old buffoons and characters. There were other structures nearby, hints of aquaducts, a temple later turned into a church. The small proscenium with its auditorium seats built into the hillside, however, was the only relic Grazano had cared enough to dig out from the dirt and undergrowth. \nGrazano went over last night's performance in his head, wondering if it was comparable to those they used to give, when they had traveled as actors. The commedia was a style of unscripted performance that required the skill and concentration of the players, and a lifetime of physical and mental training. Lines could not be memorized and simply barked out at the edge of a stage by some handsome fool in a bright costume. The actors had to be able to develop dialogue on the spot, with no other prompting than the briefest sketch of events decided on before hand. Not only did they have to be capable of improvizing their lines, but also of performing the slapstick, pantomime, tumbling, and dancing characteristic of the commedia. \nThe characters, or masks, were traditions going back a thousand years, collections of accumulated stage business, lines, and physical movements. Each mask had a ready stock of lazzi, or memorized speeches that they could fit read-made into scenes when called for. His own character was the pedantic doctor, spouter of nonsense and egotistical fraud. \n\"We're ready,\" Lombarqo said from behind him. Grazano was startled; his hearing wasn't as good as it once was, or he would have heard the other actor approach. \n\"Are we making a mistake?\" Grazano asked, in a voice completely opposite to that used on stage, all of the self-assurance and pomposity gone.\n\"No,\" the shorter man said, grinning through his thick black beard. He was dark-skinned, with large teeth and a wide nose. The doctor, by contrast, had a long, bony face suited to his slender figure, stooping slightly with age. \"We are actors. It is time the world heard of us again. We have cowered here too long.\"\nGrazano shook his head. It was one thing, putting on these rough theatricals under the stars for honest farmers and tradesmen from the village. The land was infested with actors, half of them starving. The comedies weren't as popular now, perhaps, as at their height, but they would be performing in theaters that had seen legendary troupes of a dozen or more professionals. Maybe it had been too long. \"There are only the four of us,\" he said.\n\"There will be five once we pick up Lucrezia,\" Lombarqo answered. \"And six, with Baron Udulo.\" \nLucrezia had been only eighteen when they had performed with her in Bergamo. When her father had died attempting the lazzi of the balcony, she had vowed never to act in the commedia again. Now she was in her late thirties. Lombarqo, Grazano suspected, was still madly in love with her. His own heart beat faster at the thought of seeing her again. \"You've packed the costumes?\" Grazano asked. \"The food?\"\n\"Everything. The old coach is nearly full, and the donkeys aren't going to be happy about how much they have to carry. And wine,\" he said grinning. \"We're bringing a barrel of wine. Don't back out now, you old windbag. All these years you have been complaining about not having an audience, dreaming about the days when we were traveling as the infamous comedians. Now we have a chance. Udolo said he has a letter of introduction to the Sun King's court, and enough coin to pay our way.\"\nA company of commedia actors was like a tribe. Their art required knowing one another's thoughts and habits well enough to anticipate them, to tune your jokes and movements to their own. On stage and off, if they didn't trust each other, and support one another, then they would fail. The old man, the fake doctor, looked one last time out over the hills, and at the ruins where they had rehearsed so often for the past dozen years. They were actors, he thought. It would be a hard life, but it was the only one he had to offer to his Nephew. He didn't share in his younger friends optimism, but tried to reflect, as well as he could, his enthusiasm. \n\n~Venice\n\nThe man and woman stared at each other over the late afternoon meal that he would be paying for. His smile and self-confidence told her that; she wouldn't put up with his condescension for free. The woman was Lucieza Tomolo, the daughter of a famous Arlechino who had performed for kings and queens. Now she was forced into minor roles in this water and wine-logged city, going heavily in debt to finance dubious theatrical endeavors and tedious lunches. The commedia was out of style. Now it was all revealing costumes and memorized melodrama. \nVenice rose around them in thin vertical architecture meant to echo and suggest the grand palaces of other nation-states and capitals. It the mercantile hub of a minor empire, and where her father had launched her career. The over-dressed man, Petrolino was another in a detestable series of potential financiers. Suddenly, his wine was all over his shirt and there was a sword pointed at his nose. The expression was one she made a note to herself to remember, although she doubted her eyes could cross in that particular way. \nIf this is ever a comic book, there should be a shift in the coloring, a turn a couple of notches on the wheel, closer to deeper Spring, still with outlines of lingering blues, and not-quite-believable yellows.\n“How could you do this to me?” Petrolino's assailant shouted at Lucieza in a hoarse accent perfectly calculated to elicit anger. The history it brought to mind was one of brutal conquest, sharp steel, fast horses, and burning. \n“Listen to me,” Lucieza said calmly to Petrolino, who had gone from sputtering to stuttering and was about to reach his sword. “He is not my lover. This is Lombarqo, from the company I traveled with when I was young. This is a scenario, a stunt we used to play...” \n“Lies!” The man said, whose clothing wasn't, but could have been, a military uniform. There was an enormous goose feather stuck in his hat. As he turned to face her, the man with wine on his face and shirt reached towards Lombarqo's neck. From the front it was inaccessible on account of his enormous beard. Other diners screamed, cursed, and ran into the street, avoiding horses and floating gondolas that had drifted off of the canal. \nLombarqo, who was short and round, with dark hair on his chest and arms, stepped more nimbly than expected out of the way, and the near-strangle hold turned quickly into a sprawl across the table, spilling fish, bread, and crab-meat. \nLucieza recognized a lot of the insults Lombarqo now used to infuriate Petrolino, who prided himself on his noble family and was considered an excellent swordsman. She had help write them years ago, and could, in her mind, see the notebook that Lombarqo still probably kept tucked in the back of his idiotic breeches. Petrolino, remembering that he was an excellent swordsman, drew his argument of tempered steel. The book of lazzi now flipped to the page containing references to small or otherwise ineffective genitals. \nA waiter at the restaurant tried to intervene, but found himself triangulated by both Lombarqo's and Petrolino's rapiers, and backed away, joining his customers on the horse-shit covered cobblestones. Shadows of barges turned the scene momentarily dark. Lucieza turned and walked away. She knew what was going to happen: her ex-lover would pretend to fly into a jealous rage, and draw her courtier into a swordfight, which he would then pretend to lose. At the last moment, he would regain his strenth, as if by magic, and run away into St. Darqo's square, where he would be chased, and the swordfight recommence. It was all just a prelude to a commedia performance, the pantomime of snake-oil and circus tricks. \n\nElixer of Transmagesterius\n\n“This elixer,” the man dressed up as a doctor said, trying to shout above the hawking and the natural noises of the crowd, “allows you to defy death! Drawn from the wellspring Aeternitus, the fabled fountain of vitae never ending”\nSomeone coughed. “Look,” the doctor said, “I know the marketplace is filled with old men, dressed a lot like me, with, similar mannerisms, perhaps, a tottering on senility, even. Maybe more than a little drunk. There is no reason you should trust me without evidentiary verification, ispotum esqeus verbosq. Therefore to demonstrate its powers I am going to stab my grandson to death, and then bring him back to life!” \nThis caught the attention of four armed guards and someone who owned a large amount of merchandise that stood to be destroyed if any kind of a riot ensued. They started working their way to the stage. \n“Quickly, Ginqualo,” the old man said, motioning a gangly teenage boy with a pimply forehead, wearing brightly colored tights, who was looking into the crowd warily for help. The old man, in the half-mask of the traveling theater, grabbed the boy and stabbed him in the chest. Blood spurted realistically from the wound. If the boy was an actor, he convincingly mimicked the paroxysms of death. \nAbove them fancy, half-floating hotels and artist's studios pressed together a thin vertical margin of bright early summer. The dwellings of the Venetian elite, the bankers and diplomats, were shielded from the public square by lawns and terraces of grape-dangled courtyards. The second floors of the mansions, however, directly overlooked the corner of St. Darqo's where the acting troupe had set stage. Figures flashed by as shadows in windows. \nThe only other member of the traveling stage-show visible was a clown dressed entirely in white, who juggled and did magic tricks. At this moment she decided to start playing guitar, a brisk, Romani melody played high on the neck of the already sharply tuned instrument. Much like Lombarqo's accent, it was calculated to set the audience at edge, and make them think of sharp blades and blood.\n“Not to fear!” He called out to the crowd edging away from their wheeled stage. “For I have the great elixer of Transmagisterious the alchemist, who is the dimensional protector of all foolhardy attempts to elicit coins from strangers.” The old man, shaking unsteadily, took a vial from behind the puppet-box, and struggled comically with the cork. Then he dribbled it into his grandson's blood-filled mouth, and sprinkled it on the wound in his chest. “It's okay!” he kept saying, trying to wave off the approach of a small but determined group of philanthropists. \nThey were distracted by a swordfight erupting on the other side of the square, trailing a small mob. It was Lombarqo and Petrolino dueling, the buffoon foaming at the fake-Captain (who had at some point pulled on a half-mask to disguise his features). While shouting in a dialect the audience wanted either to mock or run away from, the stout and more-than middle aged swordsman knocked into pots and baskets, pausing to keep them from overturning, flashing a smiles and winks at frightened merchants. \nFinally, panting, he got to the stage that Grazano and the others had set up, and collapsed onto it. The crowd made a clear path between them and the noble, whose cheek was bleeding and who had lost his hat. “Okay,” Lombarqo said.“I give up. Please. You win. Your mother is not a whore. It must have been your sister.”\nThe back of the stage was hidden by a curtain, and the shabby proscenium was flanked by two donkeys. The clown started doing cartwheels, slipping on the blood. The doctor was still mumbling, upturning the vial. With a sudden second wind, Lombarqo parried the nobles enraged swipes, and ran into one of these houses. Petrolino charged after him. \n“I'm alive!” the teenager with the chest wound said, sitting up suddenly. No one was watching the stage. His grandfather had chased after the market-goers and guards following the duel into the mansion. “They're on the second floor!” Someone called.\nFrom the faux-floating hotel came the sounds of the Spanish Captain's taunts, and the noble's inarticulate screams for blood and justice. Ginqualo barely had time to jump off the stage before the man in the mask dropped like an anchor from the window, crashing behind the curtain. He emerged holding a bottle of the miracle dimensional elixir, and fell from the stage to the ground.\nIn the window, the crowd returning to the small square could see Petrolino getting arrested. He was demanding his hat. \n\n~\n\nThe clown shrugged out of the costume, with the full mask with the wide eyes and idiot grin, and looked at the hat they had passed around just before the reinforcements had arrived. “Not much,” she said, taking out the coins and placing the hat on her tangle of dark hair. Venetian regulars had their own brand of discipline, but when gathered in numbers their loyalty was always to the prince's orders. Muskets had been fired, with blunderbuss inaccuracy. The shots had only scared the donkeys and expedited their escape. \n“So, I guess the crowd figured out I wasn't really dead...” The youth, Ginqualo said, pulling off the shirt soaked in pig's blood. \n“What?” The doctor asked, who was fiddling with his costume. Without his mask he appeared less ridiculous, but equally old. “Oh...right. I'm sure they did.”\n“Wait!” The fake captain said to the fake doctor, pointing down by the edge of the canal as it left the city. Lucrezia. They guided the reluctant donkeys off the street the the grass. \n“Come with us!” Lombarqo called to her as they pulled even with her, the Spanish accent now replaced with the Bergamese of his birth. “We have an invitation from the King himself to perform in Versailles!”4 \n“Really?” Lucrezia asked. The doctor and captain exchanged glances. The donkeys ate grass “Not exactly,” the old man said. “Although we have a definite notarization as such from a higher functionary in his inner circle. We've had the letter for some time, actually, only you know how things are with courtesans, stars rising and plummeting and so forth, so he only recently moved up from towel-carrier to direct attendant to his majesty’s tooth-brush holder, or something, you know how it is.” He was nervous. Like Lombarqo, he had been in love with her once. \nThe letter was real, although Malwise was exaggerating its authenticity. He was also not telling her that it clearly stipulated they were only invited to perform at the Hotel frequented by the court if Lucrezia, daughter of the famous Tomolo, was with them as their Arlequin. There were shouts nearby, probably the pursuit of the guards. Lucrezia looked nervous. “You got away pulling the stage with donkeys?” \n“Apparently your boyfriend was not very popular with the locals. Many of them took our side. They had guns, about a dozen repeaters, but probably couldn't have hit the Sun King's ass if they were the royal ass-wipers and had a...”\n“Just go!” Lucrezia hissed at them. “I'll meet you by the tree at sunset.” \nThe only continuities that really matter, she thought watching the stage-wagon bounce away, are those you can't escape. \n\nVanishing Point: Performance in Incen\nArgument: The newly reunited infamous comedians arrive at the mountain village of Inchan, where the Baron Udolo resides in exile. They plan give a performance, making use of the wondrous stage machinery constructed by the Baron, all powered by a hydraulic wheel, but their final rehearsal is interrupted by mercenaries. The comedians barely manage to escape, leaving tragedy behind them...\n\nIt rained, long downpours that blurred days and nights, the cold confining them to one another's company. Lucrezia added a new and palpable element to the dynamics of the group, of which, as improvisational performers, they were already morbidly aware. Before, the attention of the males had been directed toward Rozla, the supposed lechery of the older men held at bay by their respect for the doctor's nephew, so obviously in love with her beyond any pose or performance. Now, though, even Ginqualo was being drawn into the orbit of the older woman, for whom they had traveled to Venice, and staged their so-called “rescue”. She was important enough to the Baron they were about to visit that his support was conditional on her first burying her famous grudge and joining them on the trip to France.\nRozla, who knew nothing of the history of the so-called Infamous Comedians, had gotten Ginqualo alone (easy enough) and asked him what had happened. They were on an expedition to steal fruit from the orchard of a noble estate. Usually a risky venture, but Rozla had been able to identify the marks of her people carved inconspicuously into trunks, signifying it was relatively safe and unpatrolled. A love triangle, the youth told her, which ended when Lucrezia's father had somehow lost his balance and fallen to his death, while performing at a prince's flying court. He wouldn't tell her anything more. The roma thief had to admit that the older woman was good, both her acting and acrobatics. Then again, Lucrezia had been training in the masks since she was a girl, and Rozla had only started learning a few years ago, when the doctor had caught her stealing, and then decided to train her for her gymnastic ability. He had only rarely asked her to steal, and then only in cases like this, with the apples, where the larceny was justified by need. \nLucrezia had a better voice than Rozla, although could play no instrument. The actress, Rozla had to admit, made Lombarqo and Grazano squabble and compete for attention in a way they never had for her. As the little wagon with the two eternally braying donkeys (one pitched at a natural interval below the other, Grazano had once noted, imitating them on his lute) the pseudo-scholar was perpetually practicing his lazzi, prattling off pretend latin names for every tree, flower, and insect they passed, burying them in a constant profusion of jargon that he had embalmed, lifeless, from discarded books and folia. His scholar's robes were more pressed free of wrinkles than they had been before, and scrubbed of bits of sauce or mud. He was continually trying to write things down, on faded pages scavenged from other scrolls or folios, spilling ink on stage-sets or costumes.\nThe fake-doctor tried to record entire scripts, while everyone else recorded in his or her notebook only bits of speeches. The clown, Rozla, simply made thumb prints she said were where her feet were supposed to go while she was playing “the milk bucket” reel. The Captain told Dottore he was missing the whole point of improvisational comedy, which was that it left no written record of itself, and therefore their necks were not politically responsible. Even stable monarchies had lightning quick tectonic shifts of power, and you had to be prepared to mock, or not mock, depending on which way the winds were blowing. This had been the tradition, the taboo, for thousands of years, since before the Roman satires.\nThere was a tradition among the mercenary armies of Northern Europe, that Lombarqo had both witnessed and participated in, where a soldier, with his face swathed in bloody bandages except for his mouth, would denounce the war for gory stupidity. Neither side, in most cases, would shoot. The wounded soldier was a kind of sacred prophet, stumbling through battlefields as if blind, daring the bullets to find him, mocking what the others, crouched in trenches or barricaded in military encampments made from emptied villages, called bravery. War, Lombarqo himself had said behind that mask, half-mad with pain and loss from the butchery of his friends, was a morbid joke, a death worship of angry, silly men. \nThe Captain got into fights, both in and out of character, noticeably more often when Lucrezia was present, to the point where she had screamed at him in one tavern, while he was in the act of swinging a chair around his head at three assailants, that she was totally unimpressed by his barbaric displays, which she understood stemmed from sexual frustration but, she assured him, would do nothing insofar as ever alleviating it. The three men stopped their combat, content to simply laugh at the demoralized Captain, who collapsed into the chair that he had just been brandishing as a weapon.\nIt was three months since they had left Venice with Lucrezia. Now the days were getting longer, Spring was ending, and they were about to attempt to cross the mountains (evading, if they could, the reach of the Spanish empire) into France. Practicing their comic routines, tumbling, and bar-fighting, they had made their way through the brigand-riddled landscape, until they arrived at where Grazano and Lucrezia had grown up: the village of Inchen. The soil had been getting worse as the rains grew less, and fortunes had blown away like dust. The town had been another victim to the political in-fighting and endless regional shifts of power, granting flashes of legitimacy to extortionists, ex-generals, or con-men.\nThe same thing had been happening elsewhere, even as far as the island nation in the Atlantic, where religious fervor had caused the beheading of a royal, and the temporary reign of a theocratic parliament. When the king's son had been restored centuries later, one of the refugees from the fallout had ended up in Inchen. A heretical baron named Udolo, he was wanted by the heads of orthodox and unorthodox religions, and conversed secretly in latin with leading scientists and dissenters. Grazano, like he had with Lombarqo after he deserted from the Spanish infantry, protected the exile, hiding him in plain sight among an itinerant group of actors, given legitimacy by the daughter of the famous Harlequin Tomolo.\nThe path leading out of the village and beyond the curious stares of the villagers, up to the Baron's villa, followed a stream flowing rapidly down the mountain, occasionally frothing into rapids, but mostly babbling pleasantly. The entire journey the jouncing of the wagon had been a source of discomfort, especially for Lucrezia, although the players had learned to make a game out of trying to incorporate the unpredictable rhythms of the stage as it was drug along stony ruts by the donkeys into their improvised speeches or songs, finding melody in the braying of the animals, or treating them as hecklers and responding as such.\nIf it helps, you can imagine the difficult art of co-existence that they had just survived as similar to what the Xenians in the space opera story arc, another troupe of actors, experienced journeying between Sun-ships without any means of suspended animation. But why not, right? Life, even for a mega-planetoid traversing galaxies on a breaking wave of dimensional disturbance, is finite. At some point in time, time will again implode into a point, a cosmic cycle of crunch and expand that no information will survive. In both cases, the alien actors on the Lambent or the Infamous Comedians squabbling on the donkey-drawn cart they would transform into a stage, the span of time, the opportunities for developing loops of memorized scripts, were there to be wasted. Or, animal-like, they could be swam through gracefully. \nThe Baron was there to greet them when they came to his villa, perched on stilts beside the stream, attached to a bridge and waterwheel, in turn attached to a profusion of hydro-mechanical contrivances impossible to make sense of on first viewing, and difficult even after several close inspections. He had dammed up the current, making a small mountain lake watering tiers of hanging gardens. Grazano would ask how the villagers felt about the situation later, when he and Udolo were drinking at the Roasted Goat. For now, he waited patiently as the Baron, to his credit, gave equal attention and time to greeting each of his guests, although he saved Lucrezia for last. To Ginqualo and Rozla he gave a wink, causing the former to blush and the latter to look disgusted. The Baron, sensing their mood, suggested that they explore the premises at their own pace and discretion, whilst he and the distinguished doctor made their way to the town to purchase sustenance from the local market. Lombarqo, with his unfailing instinct for knowing when drinking would be involved, wordlessly followed.\n\n~\n\n“Mere literacy is a miracle among the villagers,” the Baron Udolu said, “invested with the sanctimony of the church. Combined with what they know about the reasons for my exile...I have tried, with limited success, not to be a notorious hermit. I climb down the side of this mountain, much as it pains me to do so, along the wagon-road no more than a goat trail at certain passes, and converse with them. There's a charming tavern called the Roasted Goat, run by a one-legged veteran of some Balkan war. I've done everything I can to desacrilize and familiarize myself to them, and still they come to me with this curiosity about the Church.”\nGrazano, still smiling unaccountably after seeing his friend after so many years, could easily imagine how the inhabitants of Incen, so similar to those of his own village, might make the reclusive and eccentric Baron a frequent subject of gossip and speculation. The goat and swineherds that made their way past his villa going up the mountain at sunrise or down at sunset (following, almost exactly, the shadow-line of neighboring ridges as it moved up or down the rocky slope, would fixate on his presence, even if it weren't for his habit of constructing inexplicable water-powered contraptions out of wood. The fake-doctor could see some of these villagers now, just a blur to his vision, but himself probably a clearly painted scene to theirs. Black splotches in the distance, identifiable by their movement and noises as dogs, danced around the goats with more exuberance than the task strictly called for.\nThe goatherds would bring news of him to the village, what the latest bizarre and inscrutable addition was to the mechanisms he had built around the watermill. This functional machine which the Baron had, to the approval of the villagers, fixed and maintained since he had moved there twenty years ago, was now dwarfed by a mobile and precariously floating stage-set. The villagers, hearing of the hermit-exile's apparently insane contraptions, would go see for themselves. The Baron did not encourage their visits, nor did he discourage them. After all, he was controlling their source of water. He merely pretended to speak less Italian than he really could, and showed genuine delight in demonstrating the stage-machinery to them. They, in turn, appreciated the effects the water-powered puppetry and pyrotechics produced, but nonetheless retained reservations as to the Englishman's sanity. Tonight they would certainly be spreading the news of the strangers' arrival. \nThey were riding down to Incen, the nostalgia hitting Grazano after some delay. Descending this direction, from the mountains where he had first played, then hunted as a youth, making ceaseless trips to get water, up above where the stream was fouled by refuse and laundry-washing. Lucrezia must be feeling, what? As a narrator, it is useless to untangle how one character puppets another in their own mind. I could tell you what Lucrezia was actually thinking: she was asleep, and dreaming about a dog running away with a brightly colored shoe, not feeling much of anything at all. \nThe town had changed. When Grazano had been his Nephew's age, the mountain passes and valleys had still been shadowed by the occasional up-root grove, with the bats and other mutated species that you, in your apergy-less dimension, have no analogues of. Now, the princes had decreed that all floating trees were the exclusive property of the crown, to be distributed to the nobility at their discretion. It was furthermore against the law of the land for any commoner to possess or inhabit any property not planted firmly on Earth. This had led to the unintended consequence of peasants in particularly swampy or scorpion-infested areas to get rid of the small pegs keeping their houses and grain-stores above the ground, to disastrous effects. It had a symbolic gesture, Grazano and Udolo agreed, an arbitrary and orchestrated act by the upper strata of society to crush the will of those below. Thus, the fact that the Baron's own villa was above the ground was as good as announcing his title to the village, or his defiance. \nThe conversation stopped as the horse and donkey's hoof-steps became less sure. It was difficult to talk, anyway, over the sound of the rapids, and the wind. Lombarqo hadn't been listening, pointedly riding his donkey backwards in the saddle, showing off one of his lazzo for the Baron. The captain now turned back around, swiveling himself with one arm planted on the uncomplaining donkey's back. “Where is this tavern?” He asked, “and how well can they fight?”\n\n~\n\nThe Baron and the fake-doctor sat at one table, while the Spaniard sat at another, singing. The songs were a series of lewd insults and innuendos, modified so as be personal attacks at the individuals in the room, who luckily, were few and in good humor. One of them even joined in on a fiddle. \n“We shouldn't stay long,” the Baron said, ordering a carafe of wine. “Lucrezia? You?” Udolo asked, ignoring preliminaries, illustrating his question an unmistakable hand gesture. Grazano treated his friend to a long, theatrical sigh, that seemed to travel right to left along his enormous eye-brows. “Him?” the Baron asked. The doctor shrugged, then shook his head. \n“We're going to have a show,” Udolo said, loud enough that the young boy waiting on them could hear. He sipped his wine. I should note that while some correspondencies exist between your dimension's history and the one that I am describing, the religions of these two worlds were actually quite different. That of this novel, a “fictional” one from your point of view, was influenced by the presence of anti-gravitational species, contributing to different kinds of “ascension” theologies. Udolo's religion might bear some resemblence to that of late 17th century Cromwellians, for example, but drinking wine, especially made in floating vineyards, was an acceptable practice.\n“Are you sure that is wise?” Grazano asked. \n“What else have I been building the stage machinery for? Why else bring Lucrezia all the way here.” He gestured at the people in the tavern, coming in from the fields. Back when he and Lucrezia were children, the flying trees would be coming back to the Earth, as they lost their buoyancy from the sun. “They saw Lucrezia riding in. She spoke with the baker, in front of the market, where we will go after this one drink to get much needed vegetables and meats, and now everyone knows, and they will be expecting a performance. I recognize what the Captain is doing. We will be forced to avoid a physical conflict by revealing ourselves as actors, and announcing an upcoming performance, correct?”\nGrazano nodded. “A week from tonight,” he said. “A full moon.”\n~\nThey were late getting back, and Lucrezia had already killed and butchered one of Udolo's goats, and was half-way to lighting a fire, a task made difficult by the wind. With the legs of lamb and pheasant meat from the market, they had more food than they needed, so Udolo called for a herder's son and told him to invite his family. \nThey played music while the animals burned, roasting them slowly despite their hunger, drinking wine and swapping stories, showing off for the baron and the goat-herders, knowing they would report the conversation widely. \n“Your father,” Grazano was telling Lucrezia, “would actually hang himself from the gallows, one trick-knot away from being strangled, and wait until a crowd assembled. If a bird landed on his shoulder he wouldn't move. Then he would free his hands, grab the robe, and in one swing be standing on the gallows.”\n“That's when you would step up,” Udolo said, “and start selling the elixir.” \n“Do you want to hear the lazzi?” Grazano asked, reaching for the mask. After a while, the hard leather had molded to the contours of his nose and cheeks, became as natural as the other role his face played underneath. Rosaletta groaned.\n“The one from back then?...” Udolo asked.\n“No, no, my latest...here: ad hominen, ad absurdam loquacious est, ad asteram per asteram amen. Ahem. From the latin. Trascribed from the last copy of the only scroll left by Transmagisterious the Third before he voluntarily decorporeated to take his place among the firmament.” \n“You mean the last scroll.” Rozla said. They had introduced her as a gypsy thief and tumbler they had hired to play the clown. Younger than Ginqualo by several years, with twice his intelligence, Lucrezia didn't trust her. Ginqualo was simply frustrated by her sexual inaccessibility. \n“The last and only scroll of Transmagisterious the mysterious, discovered in the abandoned crypt of the lost continent by the renowned, daring, and astonishingly attractive Morphologist J. Q. Rutherford only ten years ago on a small Pacific island!”\nThey discussed the coming performance, which lazzi they would enact from the infinite scroll of permutations. There was a fire, a stream with a water-mill. It was a small village in the mountains, proud of their wine, goats, and donkeys. They had scheduled a performance for seven days from then, which gave them time to build the set and sketch out some kind of outline, or argument for the improvisation.\n~\nAll I can really give now for the events of the rehearsal, Udolo's murder, and the company's escape, is a similar outline, waiting until subsequent edits for further expansion. \nThey didn't even have the performance. Some of the villagers had come to watch, giving them a chance to test the routines on an audience other than themselves. Much of the rehearsal, unfortunately, was taken up by the technical difficulties of getting the stage machinery to work. One piece in particular, a representation of a dragon or water spirit, required water from the dam to be released at a certain velocity, so as to produce, via an intricate system of linked joints and fin-like copper plates, the impetus for animal thrashing around in life-like (and, the Captain would add, life-threatening) ways. \nThe villagers got no end of enjoyment watching the Spaniard get thrown about and drenched by the Baron's tinkering. It was during a lazzi of the water-dragon that the water flow stopped, and hence the thrashing ceased. The Spaniard, without hesitation, went into his victory speech, thumping his breastplate and leaping from one side of the stage to the other, causing it to wobble threateningly on it's stilts. \nThe Baron came onto the stage from one of the “wings” which they had shielded with one of the stictched-together backdrops Udolo had clumsily painted. One of the donkeys they had brought with them from Ince was leading the other, on which the Baron, wearing the dress and mask of Pantalone, was riding, backwards.\nIt was a deviation from the plot they had established, but Lombarqo willingly set up the jokes for his own lazzi, he and the old Baron switching roles. Udolo wasn't as good of a rider, but was at least Lombarqo's equal in slapstick. “Why are you riding backwards?” The Captain asked, the mask infusing all of his gestures and utterances. The tiny cones of metal crafted near the mouths amplified the voices of the actors enough to be heard over the waterfall. \n“Because I already know what is in front of me. We all do: death. What lies behind is the mystery, memory always fading into forgetting.”\nThe baron pulled up his mask, his back to the audience, and said loud enough that only the other actor would hear: “Get everyone on stage. The royal guards are here. Call for your horse.”\n“What?”\n“Call for your horse!” The Baron shouted, in the voice of Pantalone. “Try it yourself?”\n“After I have just defeated the great water-dragon of the Isthmus, and gained his treasure?” Lombarqo said, stalling, trying to think. He caught Lucrezia's eye from behind the drop curtain, and read fear. He whistled for his horse, which he always kept untethered. Nothing happened, which meant that someone was at the stables, and had tied her, to keep them from escaping. He might have heard her neigh, or it might have been the sound of rushing water, which seemed to be getting louder. Glancing up, he noticed the gate keeping the water behind the prow-like dam was slowly rising. \nThe donkey not being ridden by Udolo started showing signs of panic, so Lombarqo did the lazzo of backwards mounting, each time somehow spinning as he swung his leg on the donkey so that he turned too far. After three increasingly ridiculous attempts, he finally rode the donkey off the stage, bowing as he rode off the wooden ramp, taking the trail up the mountain to where the horses were kept.\n“I encourage all of you not aligned with the secret religious sects or noble courts intending to arrest or assassinate me, to leave as quickly as possible. We wear these masks for a reason. We have spoken truth tonight, about the pride of the upper classes and feudal lords, about money, greed, and wars. I encourage you now to disguise your faces, and don't go home directly—wait in the village until you are sure you weren't followed. Hide in the forests if you must. My friends here, are going to escape.”\nThe herders, bakers, and trappers in the audience weren't susceptible to post-modern confusion between the world and the stage, and when they saw the uniforms beneath the cloaks, with the swords, rifles, and powderhorns, they melted into the night. Some couldn't help but stay for a moment as Lombarqo and one of the soldiers re-emerged into the lantern-light, dueling. \n“This performance is not authorized!” One of the agent assassins with the largest hat shouted. “We place all performers hereby under arrest, subject to the mercy of the upper courts.” A rifle shot went off, and Udolo tumbled off his donkey, but then sprang to his feet, unhurt. “I have the miracle elixer of Transmagisterious!” he shouted in character, just before another rifle went off, this time punching a bloody hole in his collarbone. \n“Stop!” The baron shouted. “We give up! Everyone, onstage. Onstage!”\nLucrezia stepped out of her hiding place. \n“No!” Grazano shouted, also stumbling forward. No shots came. The Captain had stabbed his opponent with his own sword, first knocking it out of the assassin's hand with the blunt edge of his own theater-weapon. Now he advanced on the two, wearing bright red uniforms but no discernible insignia, and they raised their weapons. \nA torrent of water blasted them, knocking one off his feet. The stream had been directed by the mouth of the water-dragon, but now the control gates in the dam were fully open. Dozens of mechanized panoramas and automatons whirred in manic motion, still connected to the waterwheel.\nRozla saw what was happening, and jumped onto the stage just as it fell into the rushing water. She had spent many nights when she couldn't sleep in the past week out here by the stage, going through her lazzi in a half-dreaming trance, or inspecting the Baron's odd constructions by candlelight. Once, Lucrezia had caught her, and asked if she had figured it out. \n“It's another wagon, like ours. The things we've been using as the steering for the floating ship are actually wheels, if you take off those rounded wooden pegs.” Lucrezia had nodded, but then pointed out what the Roma girl had missed: it was designed to separate from the rest of the platform, and fall into the stream. While the drop was too far now, and the water level too low, if the dam were opened it might be possible to use the stage as a raft in the case of escape. If certain ropes were cut...\nRozla had seen the Baron swinging his sword at the ropes, then grabbing a lantern when the blunted blade proved unable to cut the fibers, and throwing it against the stays where the ropes were tied. She jumped just as the stage fell clear, and was carried downstream. A railing that had previously seemed superfluous now saved Grazano and Lucrezia's life as they were thrown off balance and backwards by the sudden fall and pull of current.\nThe water had doused the firing pans of the remaining rifles, so they came at the wounded Baron with swords, obviously not intending an arrest. \nThe Captain leapt, after kissing his horse goodbye, and wishing her a long and lustful life. He landed badly, and only a change in the stream-bed saved him from toppling over the edge. The other thing that Rozla and Lucrezia had talked about the night they were up inspecting the stage, was that it was actually floating. The “treasure” box that they were using as a prop in the sea-dragon scene was far heavier than it needed to be, and locked. The dragon-thing itself, in three individual parts (head, torso, and tail) was bulky and weighed down with metal plates. It was for this reason that Rozla, after checking that everyone was unhurt, moved to throw some if not all of these ballasts overboard, to see if they could fly. \nCarving a stage out of an up-root tree would just be another addition to the long list of things Udolo had done in defiance of the law, each of them a possible reason for the attack. He was now in a sword-fight on a burning platform, a minor collapse of which tossed the soldier down into the rushing water. Rozla had already dumped the dragon's tail, which now sat in the middle of the current, thrashing happily.\nLombarqo didn't have to look downstream to know what was coming. He had walked every day in the last week past the bend where the stream, even with the increased flow from the open dam, would be impassable, and the rocks would smash the raft into splinters. The trunk had to go. He could feel that Rozla's guess was right, and that this stage was far different from the one they had dragged through Venice. Grazano grabbed his shoulders, yelling for him to stop, but Lombarqo dragged the chest with all his strength to one side of the raft, which caused it to keel crazily, correcting the imbalance when the trunk splashed into the rapids with a crazy leap and spin into the air, that nearly thew all of them overboard. \nBack at his villa, Udolo watched with dismay as, in the far distance, the Captain tossed the trunk overboard. He was stabbed again by the assassin, who whispered unpleasant things about heretics and the afterlife. The burning planks collapsed, and they both fell, Udolo already dead.\nGrazano and Lucrezia stared at the gold coins, cutlery, and antique inlaid weapons that had spilled out of the trunk into the stream-bed, most of it already lost under the water. That was to have been their means of travel to France, to the flying court of the Sun King. \nThe stage, free of it's weight, lifted into the air. \n~ \n“There's something I should tell you,” Rosaletta said. “It was me, they were after, not him.” \n“I'm pretty sure it was Udolo” Lucrezia replied, looking down at the rapidly diminishing flames behind them.\n“No,” Lombarqo said, who was still panting, trying to reload (which was a long ordeal in anything other than an airborn stage-wagon). “I'm pretty sure it was me.” Gazano, Rozla, Lucrezia, and Ginqualo all stared at him. “That's why I had to shoot that Sergeant before he spoke. So he wouldn't reveal the truth...”\n“No,” Lucrezia said. “They are the same agents who killed my father.”\n“Your father fell off a balcony!” the Rozla yelled.\n“He was drugged!” the actress shouted back.\n“It was Petrolino,” Ginqualo said, “I recognized him from Venice. They must have been hired mercenaries.”\nThey all had reasons to be afraid.\nRozla was a theif, and an exile from her people, deemed traitorous for singing songs that should have remained within the clan. Lombarqo, the Captain, was a deserter, and during a long career as both womanizer and mercenary had tied the lines of his blood into many feuds and calls for vengeance. The doctor, Grazano, the stuffy scholar in the voluminous robes, was perhaps the most innocent of them, and least likely to be the case of the attack on the Baron's villa. The mock-Venetian was annoying, certainly, and had been involved in enough cons, schemes, escapades, impersonations, and escapes to warrant the well-deserved ire of most of Italy and part of France. The baron himself, Alfronz Udolo, was probably the most the most likely target. \nIn the town below them, they saw the regiment of an army, but Lombarqo, who knew the uniforms of almost all regiments, couldn't identify to whom they owed allegiance. At least, from this distance, the town seemed peaceful. The stage started to sink lower into the ground just as the mountains again drifted towards them. They found more to throw overboard, until finally they tossed, just before the small craft collided with a rocky, goat-inhabited cliff, the middle section of the water dragon, which squirmed as it fell, landing somewhere beyond their vision to confuse goats and other creatures. \n“Like the dragons of old,” The doctor said, “With it's tail in the waters, it's body in the land, and it's head in the sky.\nAs they flew, the surviving top-most part of the dragon curved in the wind, as a sinuous mast-head.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: GOTHIC INDUSTRY\nTe2ao, Trela4, and the injured bone ape, Chan2, followed the setting suns to the gates where they rested and sang with small groups of others, trading stories. Everything was changing, TreLa4 thought. She had snuck off the island of the Linguists, and now the fish and tree tribes were to be at war. After so many years, she wasn't sure if Or8o still loved her, or if she would be able to find him in the hills when he and his family must have fled. \nAs they walked, she chewed the bitter ur-tree leaves, but since leaving the island the feeling of well-being was leaching out into the mountains, leaving her open to an onslaught of thoughts she wasn't sure were her own. The mental walls the Council had taught her to create were breaking down, and the swamps of psychic noise, songs, and confusion were waiting to engulf her. She could hear Te2ao, the tall runner with greying fur on his back and torso, thinking to the woman from the bone tribe. She had the skull of a baby wolf sewn into her back, and as they walked Trela4 stared into its eyes as they bounced up and down with the woman's steps. She had once been Te2ao's lover, and now had fought him over her.\n“You don't believe the shamans are really possessed?” She was asking Te2ao, in telepathy that Trela4 couldn't hear.\n“No,” he thought. “I sing because it helps me control my breath as I run, to take my mind off exhaustion. The masks carved from the roots make telepathy stronger, and those from the trees hide your thoughts from other apes. We sing for ourselves, and pretend otherwise to say things for which, otherwise, we would be ashamed.”\n“If the spirits of the dead don't take over the voices in the masks, how can we know history? In my tribe, everyone has an animal spirit, and channels its voice. Like the runners, we are people of the earth.”\n“I wonder, though,” Te2ao said. “If it were really true, if the ghosts persisted, would wearing the masks of the dead really be permitted? The reason the taboo exists is to keep the ghosts from gaining too much strength, and the ancient gods from rising up against our own deities of the present Earth” He picked up a stone. “Chip this surface here, and it could be an accident, and would teach our children's children nothing about the ancient implements of war. Chip it here and here, and it becomes a sharpened edge. I would be exiled forever is such a stone was found in my possession.”\nA roar, far off in the distance, told them of one of the great bears defending his territory. \n“The floating library of trees has a secret store of such things, and they use them to wage war against the other tribes.” The bone-woman, rattling her necklaces of bleached metacarpels, glared back at Trela4 over her shoulder, matching the expression of the baby wolf-skull. The path curved around the side of the cliff and opened up a morning vista of misty blues and greens, already heavy with the smell of salt. Te2ao thought at the two of them a map, showing how far they had to go until the Delta village. It started, lightly, to snow.\n“I don't think they do,” Te2ao said, pointing at the huge disk of flying groves with its smear of shadow. They were ahead of it now, since its pace had slowed after skirmishes with the wood and water tribes. Strange clouds hung over it, a spiral of rain-clouds caught in the odd trap of weather the larger groves produced. “Their knowledge comes from where they say it does: the ur-trees, and their chants.”\n“Trela4,” he said out loud. “Tell us the song of what would happen should the tribes paint in caves, carve in stone, or want their names to be remembered.” \nTrela4 began, talking about how the knowledge of how to kill more efficiently would be left for the fire tribes to find and copy. This knowledge over time would be added to. The stones and metals themselves would be granted a kind of telepathy, whose thoughts stretched beyond death. Nomads would cease circling, following auroch herds, fish, and seasons, and would begin to try and force the ground to grow crops at their command. Animals would be made to live in enclosures, and people would forget the ground and sky, knowing only the insistent thoughts of plowing, sowing, and building. Larger and larger tributes would be demanded by false chieftains who wanted immortality. The chants would be fixed, without so much as a word that could be altered.\nChan2 didn't understand the language, but felt intimations of Trela4's returning thought-sending, although dark and garbled. \n“Now,” Te2ao thought, “what is the difference between painting in caves, and the song-possession practiced by the professional musicians?” Like Trela4, he had once had dreams of becoming important, famous. His telepathy was weak, so he had become a runner instead, where his poor mind made it possible for him to travel far, and find the thin lines between the attractor basins of tribes and temples that tried to pull in his thoughts and make them stay. \n“Sounds don't last as long as ink,” Chan2 said. \n“Okay,” Te2ao thought, “but the reason the Law exists is to limit power. The power the dead hold over the living. So why channel our ancestors at all? Why do all the songs need the mask of a ghost, when it is the songs, and not the singer, that survives? Trela4, you left the Linguists' island because you suspected their chants were rote and arbitrary, and their memorization not a task equal to trees that shaded your rehearsals. The leaves themselves held the knowledge, having been selectively cultivated by thousands of generations. Their wood, sap, roots and berries are a library, a history more extensive than the painted walls of the deepest and most secret caves.”\nHe held out his wiry arm, twigs and small parasites stuck in the long grey hair. “Our bodies are the same. Libraries. So why sing songs that have been sung before, and constantly hum the praises of legends owned by some glory-hungry chieftain? The same old heroes, whose fates are decided not by the people of the tribes but by the Elect, those closed tight circles of telepathy. They might as well be like the Linguists, singing their words out loud because they don't want the uninitiated to understand them. To touch those continuities of narrative you have to petition and flatter those who sit at the greater fires, and force tedious rites of learning in order to access their circle. Music becomes more about the singers than the song. Structures of power are as sure a way of repeating the past as are stone axes and runes carved in bones. \n“Instead, I became a runner, where although my audiences are small, my stories are my own.” Birds and insects swam in melodic crescendos around them, underneath the louder calls and brays of the megafauna far off, echoing.\nSpavens\n\nNow everyone traveled on trains. There were no automobiles yet, nor flying cars, but if the new Science Fiction cheap sheets were to be believed, they were on the horizon. This was Boston, Massachusetts, in a year you would recognize roughly as 1892. There had been a civil war, similar to yours, in which Lieutenant Spavens had been shot three times. Once in the leg, which had given him his limp and telepathic sense for weather, once in the elbow, resulting in full amputation of his left arm, and once in the head. He didn't remember much about the head-wound, or anything about the years after that. His memories of the decades following were cloudy, as if permanently obscured by gun-smoke. Every morning part of him woke up thinking he was still in the war, being given the dishonorable discharge in front of his troops, denounced as a spy. \nWell, he had been a spy, that much he remembered. About his honor he wasn't so sure. He constantly had to remind himself, like a litany or chant, about what had gone on in in the recent past. Usually, he could do this in conversation with his daughter, but no one spoke on trains. \n“Isn't it strange how no one ever speaks on trains?” the one-armed veteran said to Zabella.\n“No,” she answered. She was reading a book, with elaborate etchings overgrown with florid and arabesque illustrations. The page she was on showed a number of well-dressed women of various ages but identical faces, one of them crying, with a wedding cake on a table and a puppy with its paws on a velvet box exploding into enormous bows and ribbons that curled out of the frame to join, with sickening and perverse accuracy, the design from the upper margins. She was upset with him, understandably. Days before, Spavens had told her that the man she had been living with all her life was not her father. Her mother had asked him to take his granddaughter away, across the country, to keep her safe. That image, at least, was perfectly etched into his mind: Lily, usually so calm, pleading with him when he had come to visit. “Keep her away from him,” she had said. “Please.” There had been no signs of bruises on her face, but Spavens knew there were more ways than one to hurt a woman, and his daughter was obviously scared. Her husband, Henry Love, was a cold and unreadable man, whom Spavens had never trusted. He was rich, though, and could provide for Lily and her daughter in a way that Roger Malwise, heretic minister turned political agitator, and now penniless book-peddler, never could. Yet that was to whom Lily had told him to take her daughter.\n“I think it's strange,” the man sitting next to Daring Spavens (his parents had named him Daring, since his father had died in battle the day that he was born) said, giggling. She had grey streaks in her hair, and an umbrella folded in her lap. She was reading a French romance. Probably, he thought, based on an Italian play, published in Britain and reprinted by rogue publishers in the U.S. who then claimed copyright. The middle-aged man with a neatly-trimmed mustache and monocle hadn't lifted an eyebrow. He was a fixated on a newspaper, the front page screaming about the labor riots in Chicago, the anarchist plots and court battles over monopolies and tariffs on the ur-crops and ur-coal trading. His pants were indifferently ironed, a wrinkle running down the length of his skinny thigh. \nOver the the clanking of the train, all four of them rolled their eyes upward to follow the sound of running footsteps on the metal roof. It was raining outside, and the passenger cars, unlike the freight, had slick domed ceilings. Whoever it was had to be crazy. They heard the owner of the footsteps jump to the car in front of them. Seconds later, the sounds were repeated by another, heavier, set of steps. The young man to their left went back to reading, then the woman with the umbrella and gloves sitting on their right. \n“I can't read on trains,” the old veteran said. He didn't hear as well as the others, and thought the sounds might have been thunder. “The words swim on the page, and I start to feel ill. It might have something to do with this.” He pointed to his forehead, and looked around to see if any of them were listening. The woman with the french novel was. He wasn't sure how many days they been on the train, in that same car, and how many conversations they might have exchanged. In his hand-bag were a series of letters that Roger had sent Lily over the years, to the address Spavens had given him that night he had picked him up from the jail in Chicago, and told him that Lily was pregnant, and he would never see her again, and never meet the baby he had fathered. Most of the letters Roger had sent, he had given to Lily, after reading them himself, but these he had kept. He didn't want her to be reminded of her old love affair, or question her new marriage to the railroad and drift-oil baron. Also in the bag was a copy of Lily's latest manuscript, an installment of the serialized novella about the savage bandits and horse-thieves on the west coast, which she had been publishing under a pseudonym. In this, too, he had been a go-between, sending copies of Lily's work to Malwise, never telling him who the author was.\nIt sounded now like something was under the train, and crawling backwards from the sound the two sets of footsteps had traveled. Other passengers looked from the stained carpet of the floor to one another, uncertainly, through cigar smoke.\n“I can't remember the things I read,” Spavens said. “I have these books, every time I go through them I make notes to myself in the margins, summaries of what's going on. Zabella, my god-daughter, she reads them and tells me the notes are...inaccurate.” The man sitting next to them laughed, once, and then was silent, his eyes still never having left the newspaper. The eye on the side nearest them was rendered inscrutable by the monocle. Occasionally, he twirled the ends of his mustache back and forth between his thumb and finger, like a villain in a silent movie.\n“I should start writing in invisible ink, then I could just summarize the summaries as they disappear, end up with a whole different book...Did I tell you I was a spy in the war? Both sides, in a way. I was a Captain for the Blue-coats, for about a month until I disobeyed orders and was shot with dishonorable discharge. Shot, I mean, then given dishonorable discharge.” He pointed again to the scar on the side of his forehead. Occasionally, he pointed to the wrong side of his head, and then realized that he was using his phantom arm. The older woman with the umbrella began to look uncomfortable. Her accent, he remembered, had been notably southern.\n“Riding on a train reminds me of the war,” he said softly, too quiet for his own ears, but loud enough that he knew the other three could hear. “At any moment, you could die suddenly. Things could, with a little mechanical hitch, go horribly and irrevocably wrong.”\nThere was a loud banging sound under them, and Zabella caught her breath. It sounded like a chain loose under the train car, some kind of giant, angry ghost. Even the ex-Captain heard it, although he thought it was a sound remembered from thirty odd years ago. \n~Malwise\n\nRoger Malwise, age 44, was sitting among the glass and steel of the train station, writing a letter to the woman he loved, who he hadn't seen for twenty years.\nDear Lily,\n\nI'm in all this noise and light, the kind of architecture we used to rail against in the speeches you wrote for me, waiting for your father to arrive. His telegram surprised me. The first time I met him was the last time I saw you, that night, with the riot at the newspaper office, when I ended up in jail. He told me I would never see you again, and it was the worst night of my life. Worse, even, than when I was defrocked, cast out of the Church for preaching evolution, or when I lost my race for a congressional seat, for advocating revolution. \nDaydreaming, now, I let myself imagine that this day might be the best of my life, that when the train slides down from its tracks in the sky you will step with him off the platform. Oh, but what would you think of me? The intervening years have not treated me well, I am afraid. I have less hair, and heavier bags I carry under my eyes, and have even developed a belly, that sticks out against my cheap and tattered clothes. I look like, and am, a poor traveling salesman. \nDid I tell you that on my last trip to try and drum up subscriptions, the publishers didn't even give me real books, but rather blocks of wood, with only the covers? Hollow and wooden inside, with only a fraying bit of show to recommend them. A metaphor for something, either the industry or myself. When asked what the novels are about, I, who have myself never seen their pages, can only make things up! At least before on my endless train and carriage rides, I had things to read. Now, the only printed pages I really care are bibles. They are the only book that ever really sells. Yes, I am afraid I will never, really, escape the church. At least it is a good translation.\nFor me, though, there is no going back to my previous beliefs, either religious or political. Since the publication of Wallex and Spater's monumental works more than three decades hence, everything has changed.5 It is impossible that you will love me now—even my daydreams show me the impossibility of our ever being reunited, but that is of little consequence. I love you, in the same way I used to love God, and his prophet who was hung from the gallows, and gave wood from then on (as we are supposed to believe) the power to float, and imbued creation with the potential to be saved. I no more expect a response from you than I ever did from him.\nAnd yet I have your stories. I know that L. Dreadful must be you. Since the first manuscript was sent to me I had no doubt; the way you write is unmistakable. The Savage Bandit stories have become a new kind of scripture for me. I pore over every installment I am sent, convinced that there are messages, revelations, that you have hidden in the pages just for me. Perhaps you are afraid to write to me directly, because of your father, or husband. I recognize, too, the politics and philosophies we used to share: the sympathy for the wronged, oppressed, and outcast, masked as this sympathy is by their bloodthirsty acts of revenge. The reason, I think, that the stories have sold as well as they have is that your readers recognize the justice in those violent retributions, and by reading them seek to assuage their own guilt, their complicity in what their race and nation has done...They thrill at the ghost of the Savage Bandit, able to disappear into the night and nightmares, brought back twenty years after his death by the frenzied dances of the native tribes. While on the road, I do all I can to sell more copies.\nOnce things are published they, like species, take on a sort of life of their own. My failed political aspirations have taught me this much: the louder the platform, the less control you have over your own voice. In the age of print it is editors and bookmakers who are the new clergy. I have come to think of language as something of a virus, like the tuberculosis too many of my family have died of. \nThere is another book, too, that I have been pushing, during my latest ill-fated forays into the plains and pastures of our young and troubled nation: 2013, by Edwin Bergamy. Surely, you have heard of it? It posits an alternative world, in which apergy does not exist. Some, of course, call it blasphemy, since the flying groves and energies are a visible sign of our potential grace and salvation. The same reason that the Levelers are thought to be spreading damnation with their politics, and their dream of a world where the huge factories, mansions, and Indian reserves are brought back to Earth. In Bergamy's world, though, the absence of the up-root trees and their fossilized deposits makes no discernible difference! The history of that planet, bound to the laws of gravity unlike ours, still has as much of war, poverty, injustice and oppression! It has prompted numerous sequels in response, both by those that agree and disagree with his dystopian, socialist view. \nWhen I describe the contents of that block of wood, as often as your own Savage Bandit stories, I often find myself kicked out of the door by stern wives or angry husbands. The same men whose morals allow them to purchase the latest yellow books from France, or “special” decks of playing cards, suddenly show outrage at Bergamy's thought experiment, or your own tales of vengeful Mexicans, whose land we stole, or “redskins” our government has hounded nearly to extinction! \nIn his telgram, your father said that he was bringing someone with him here to Boston. Oh, if only it were you, and I could put these stained and wrinkled pages in your hand! I know, however, that this wish is impossible. You will remain only in my heart and mind, but that is enough. His train is arriving soon. May I tell you that I love you? If not, permit me then to wish you all possible happiness.\nForever yours,\nRoger Malwise\n\nLooking up at high neo-classical arches of the North-Eastern railway station, he went over again in his mind the telegram he had received from Lily's father. It was too short, with too much ambiguity crammed into those few words. His whole life, he had felt encumbered by a overabundance of language, in contrast to a world of telegrams, newspapers, and the taciturnity of businessmen and farmers. His career, he felt, had been merely looking for excuses to talk, or to write, to account for the overflow of syllables pounding in his skull. When he was young, he had assume their source to be divine, indicating some kind of sacred calling. Now, he felt they were indicative only of a peculiar form of madness.\nFour years ago he had just lost a race for the congressional district, after his opponent had republished his past heresies, which he had written after the first suppressed wave of excitement surrounding scientific origins of homo sapiens. \nHe had enjoyed the political stump-speeches, even without Lily to write them, veering from his planned program, saying things that, when reported later, made him sound crazier than the craziest of the fervent and orthodox laity or the most radical Leveler. After four years, he was going to see his daughter again. \nThe morning sun made dramatic shadows, highlighting the griminess of the drift-warped stones and platforms. Ever since the industrial revolution had discovered a way to produce anti-gravitational effects from dead ur-trees rather than living ones, major cities around the globe had been in a race to see who could raise their buildings and sky-rails the highest. It was a waste, Roger thought.\nLike the crystal palaces built to celebrate man and science lifting away (in predictable and tedious iconography) from the baser spheres of earth, free from sin and instinct. Like the ridiculous current fashion in hats, trying to outdo everyone else in altitude, until doorways became littered with head-ware knocked off by lintel beams.\nThe news from Europe fifty years ago had been that the urboreal tree-species thought to have existed only in the New World had once been native to the Eurasian continent. Archaeological ruins that had always been puzzling could be explained only, these scientists had claimed, by early use of ur-tree roots to reverse gravitational polarity. This had led to the discovery that the coal deposits of decomposed up-root forests could be burned to produce anti-gravitational effects far exceeding what was possible with living, or recently lumbered groves. The industrialized north could now mine fossilized deposits of drift-feul to compete with southern plantations, worked by African slaves. While the civil war ended the large-scale agricultural cultivation of anti-gravity crops by the plantation system, the north still employed millions of laborers in jobs placing health and safety at risk. \nThere was a shadow-class living under the apparent opulence of the new industrial cities. In Chicago alone, thousands died every month on the floating railroad tracks and bridges. Meanwhile, the native inhabitants of U.S. territories were being pushed West and South, to reservations sacred only until the next grove of ur-trees was discovered in some forgotten valley, and the process began again.\nThe revolutions of Europe dispersed seeds of leveling and socialism across the Atlantic, into the dissatisfied and volatile political landscape of North America. Once all of the ur-trees had been logged for flying ships, or ground to pulp to run the trains, what then would keep the economy from collapse? The game had been started, though, and the all-or-nothing contest of empire meant nations had to mobilize as much and as fast as possible for total war. It was madness. More bloodthirsty gothic than anything his scandalized cousins would find in his library. \nRoger found himself reading the headlines on the back the newspaper of the man sitting next to him at the bar. He was responsible for the gravied biscuit crumbs that had been advancing at Roger's elbows. The bookseller cleared his throat, coughing a pleasant smile onto his face. \nA long beard and sun-wrinkled face turned. The man made a few sallies across his lips with a napkin. “Read about the riots, eh?”\n“They ought to be shot,” The man said, thumping the table, rattling a dozen saucers and smearing gravy with his coat-sleeve. “Every one of them.”\n“The rioters?” Malwise asked. \n“The strikers.” The man growled. I own stock in U.S. Rail, Western Steel, and half the mills in Illinois.” \n“If I may,” Roger said, reaching into his briefcase. “There is a book I happen to have suited precisely to your tastes. You have heard of the utopian novel 2013?” \n“He ought to be shot.”\n“Who?”\n“The fellow who wrote that. From New Zealand.”\n“Edwin Bergamy?” the bookseller asked, putting the volume he was about to bring out back in the case, and reaching surreptitiously for another. “The author of 2013?”6 \n“Poisoning the thought of the lower classes with that filth. Inciting riot and revolution. A world without apergy? Telepathic savages? Ha! Shoot him!” \n“We just so happen to have on our list of titles a response to Bergamy's popular utopia, written by a mogul of industry and prominent representative in the Continuity Party.”\n“Oh?” the business-man said, asking the gentleman author's name.\n“Anyway, here is my card, stop by our office anytime. We also sell bibles. And, er,” he winked, “other sorts of titles. For gentleman like yourself.” The train Lily's father was on was thundering into the station, floating up to the platform on a nest of rails, cables, smoke, and shadows. Roger stood and tipped his hat to the stranger, forgetting to pay for his coffee and roll. The businessman shook his head and handed over a few extra bills when the waitress complained minutes later. \nThe world, he mused as he brushed his beard of crumbs, was full of parasites.\n~Orlando\n\nOrlando Hightower held on to the undercarriage of the train, lodging the walking stick with his bundle tied on the end in between gaps in the grimy Steel. The noise was deafening. The Pushman guard had found him early that morning, sleeping in the empty freight car. Before he had come fully awake the drifter he had met the night before had been tossed from his ankle over the side of the train. The sunlight was bright and streaked with rain. He had ran, climbing up the ladder on the opposite side of the car onto the roof, dashing along the top of the train until he came to the smooth turtle-like backs of the passenger cars. A Midwestern expanse of prairie grasses and barbed wire fences flew past around him. He jumped across to the next car, feet scrambling for purchase, his arms out like a tight-rope walker. \nOrlando, out of habit and principle, hadn't paid for a ticket, hopping the train that he knew Zabella and her grandfather would be on all the way back on the West Coast, and staying with them since, avoiding the guards and more dangerous hobos. The night before he had switched trains in the Chicago railyards, almost getting caught trying to follow the one-armed old man and his grand-daughter when they switched lines. The past week had been the first time he had really seen the squalor of those who lived and worked in the shadows of the floating railways. Across the states, the Pushman company had been squeezing its workers for all they were worth. The Steel and Rail tycoon Alfred Pushman had built his own little kingdom for the workers he employed, and he owned the church, police, and city hall. As landlord he took workers' rent directly from paychecks. No court in the land would rule against him, and no politician speak out for fear of reprisal. \nIn Chicago, the Levelers had organized a strike. When the police had been sent in, they had been beaten and captured by the strikers. Then, at the request of Alfred Pushman, the president had sent in the national guard. Rioters on the floating stations set fire to the train cars, pushing them down on the troops. Eventually, the stations were retaken and rail transportation resumed. \nThat had been years ago. Now conditions were worse then ever, the unions all but illegal in most of the states held in the steel-and-fire grip of national monopolies and the hidden mechanics of financial capital. Wealth was becoming liquid, and the terms of its fluidity determined by courts more and more compromised by conflicts of interest. \nOrlando's father had been a slave-owner in Alabama, who had raped and killed his mother. Escaping the world of semi-legal slavery and violence of the reconstruction South, he had barely outran the men his land-owning father had sent to kill him. He traveled to New York, and left to become a merchant seaman when he was 17, later abandoning his ship and living for years roaming the Pacific Islands. In California, he had fallen in love with Zabella Malwise. When she told him she was leaving with the old Captain to meet her failed clergyman/politician father, he had decided to follow them. He was around 24 years old, and hadn't told Isabella yet about his black mother.\nWhen the Pushman guard jumped down on to the flat bed in between the two halves of the train, he couldn't figure out where the freeloader had gone. He couldn't have made his way along the sides to another door that fast. His cap and uniform were soaked a darker blue by the cutting rain. He was underpaid and angry. Bending down, he looked underneath the train cars. \n“Sneaky little bugger,” he said. Grinning, he walked to where a thick snake of chain was coiled up in a heap of rust-flakes and sawdust. He had been one of the workers called in to break the strikes in Chicago. They had put him and a dozen others in a closed train car, without telling them anything about where they were headed. The first they knew of the strike was when the stones started hitting the sides, and they had opened the doors to the snarling crushing chaos of batons and bodies. All because the strikers wanted one less hour of their work-week, one more dollar to spend on liquor or tobacco. He unwound the chain and started to let it play out under the train where the raggedly dressed drifter was hiding.\nOrlando had heard of the gravity-sickness, the weird feeling of reality coming unglued. He had experienced it the night he slept in the railyards in Chicago. Never, though, had it felt as strong as it did then, as if the world were ripping open. It were as if he could see two futures for himself, one where the deadly whip of the chain knocked him free to be mashed to pulp in the narrow moving alley of steel and rock, and the other where he held on until the point when the rails started to lift off of the ground, and the apergentic trusses and the momentum from the steam engines propelled them into the air. The chain, in the second future, fell harmlessly over the rails, and he watched it dangling above him as he clung upside down, and the Massachusetts landscape dropped/rose until he could see forests, rivers, barns and windmills. \nStation of Noise and Light\nRoger Malwise meets his daughter ~ Orlando joins them.\n\n“This is Zabella: your daughter.”\nSince Roger had picked up the telegram at the post office from Spavens, he had rehearsed various attitudes he could take when confronted with his old lover's father: indifference, anger, or some kind of beneficent and aloof forgiveness, indicating his ability to rise above old wrongs and grudges. The more malicious part of him had even entertained, briefly, the idea of not meeting him at all, or arriving late. All of those anticipated postures evaporated with the one-armed veterans words. \nHis daughter.\nThe shrill whistle of a departing train gave him, fortunately, a few moments to scramble for his scattered thoughts, during which interval he and Zabella stared at one another with, Spavens wryly noted, nearly identical expressions of shyness, hope, and petulant fear. \nShe wasn't attractive, Malwise noted, at least not by the tastes of the late 19th century, which tended towards golden curls and bright blue eyes. Both her hair and irises were dark, severely cut bangs drawing a line across a too-large forehead, the rest of her hair hanging straight, reaching her shoulders without any fashionable additions of bows or ribbons. There was intelligence, though, in her gaze and the tight set of her mouth and chin. That, the ex-minister thought, is why the world would not find her pretty by their standards: her face is too masculine, too much like his. \nHe wasn't sure what he should do—hold out his hand, embrace her, or take off his hat and bow like a character in an old romance. “I'm...I'm...” he was stammering when another voice cut through the echoes of the crowd on the platform.\n“Zabella! Zabella!” The young girl's face lit up as a muscular, well-tanned youth wearing torn and dirty clothes, with bruises and scrapes on his cheek ran up to her. He's part negro, Malwise thought, and then felt guilty for the observation. He watched as the boy and his daughter clasped each other in the embrace that Malwise, seconds before, had been hoping for himself. \n“How did you get here?” Zabella asked, in a voice her father was hearing for the first time.\n“Hopped trains,” the scruffy young man said.\n“All the way?” The one-armed veteran asked, looking at the new arrival with recognition, but also some distrust. “All the way from San Cambino?” \n“I had some close scrapes with the pushy-men, but I made it.”\n“Roger,” Spavens said roughly, “Orlando. A friend of Zabella's. Orlando, this is Roger Malwise...Zabella's father.” The boy hesitated for only a moment before shaking his hand, saying he was pleased to meet him.\n“Why?...Why are you here?\n“Well, sir,” Orlando said, looking sideways at Zabella and grinning, “I'm in love with your daughter.”\nSpavens, feeling dizzy from the noise and light on the train platform in the upper levels of the station, that reminded him vaguely of a battlefield, had a sudden, awful thought: what if, when Lily had said “keep her away from him,” it hadn't been her husband to whom she was referring?\n\nMerfield Publishing\n\nAt the publisher's, Orlando sat in the hall on the second floor, holding a book with cheap paper covers and smearing ink. Inside, on the other side of a closed door that, as a result of the building settling was not quite level with the frame, leaving gaps for sound to travel through, Zabella's father, her real one, was arguing with another man, who Orlando assumed to be in charge. He had wanted to stay with Lily, but something in the stare of the woman there (some relation of Lily's he hadn't caught), had warned him away. It had the close and unhealthy smell of poverty, worse than the tiny cabin of a ship. He was tired, and could have used with a bath, but enduring the put-upon airs and thinly veiled disapproval would have been too much for him, after weeks of sleeping in train cars under the free and open air. \nSo instead, he was here, where Lily's father, apparently some kind of traveling bookseller, was picking up new volumes before they headed back out west. This time, the one-armed veteran had insisted, they were buying him a ticket. \nOrlando looked down at the book in his hands. The lurid illustration on the cover showed a shirtless, mad-eyed mexican holding a bloody dagger, which he had just plunged into the chest of a well-dressed white man. “Marco Valenzo:” the title read, “Blood-curdling tales of the West Coast Bandit.” If what Zabella had told him was true, the book had been written by none other than her own mother, for whom L. Dreadful was a pseudonym. Holding his hand as they had walked away from the train station, she had told him that her mother had been penning the scandalous stories for years, sneaking them out of the house with the help of her one-armed grandfather. She had only just learned this within the past few days, along with the fact that the man from whom they had keeping the transactions secret, Lily's rich, tyrannical father, was actually not her father. Her real father was the one to whom the secret manuscripts had been delivered. Although they had just met him, both Zabella and Orlando considered this an improvement. \nIt was hard for Orlando to imagine Zabella's mother, who had struck him as a pale, docile woman, writing the book he had now held in his hand. Many of the words he didn't know, but those he could make out justified the reputation the stories held. Also, there were the illustrations. \nOh, the secrets that dwelt in that high-windowed house in the hills, with the terraces and fir trees. He himself had done his fair bit of sneaking, and had noticed the old veteran coming and going at unusual times, usually when the husband was away. Although the husband was away, Orlando had also noticed, most of the time. Zabella's mother had caught him once, as he was climbing down from Zabella's window. He had dropped the remaining distance, and turned to face her. They had stared for a long moment, mutually measuring one another's intent. It was dusk, and she had just come back for a walk in the forest, with mushrooms or something in a basket. Zabella was in the window, looking down at them. \n“Be careful,” her mother had said, and then went inside the house. Orlando had met, or tried to meet, Zabella's eyes before moving off into the woods, too scared to follow the road.\n“It's too much of a risk!” Merfield was saying. He was a large man, taller than Malwise. The Lieutenant was looking out the window, down at the dingy back-street. “It's not just the gore, but the politics. If the outlaws were more evil, or their victims a little less so, their revenge depicted as a bit less justified, then there wouldn't be a problem.”\n“Pathos,” Malwise said, his jaw clenching in frustration. “The narrative demands that the reader be emotionally involved, to empathize both with the slayers and the slain.”\n“The commission on public morality will revoke our license,” Merfield said, taking a handkerchief from his waistcoat and dabbing sweat from his forehead.\n“Nonsense,” Spavens said, turning from the window. “These are clearly cautionary tales—warnings about the depravity of outlaws and thieves.”\n“Yes, yes,” Merfield said, looking again at the grizzled man who had just brought him the latest L. Dreadful manuscript, written in the same neat, practiced hand as all the others. Finally, Roger's mysterious correspondent revealed. The man has an impressive beard, the publisher thought, fingering his own, which was shorter and more neatly trimmed. It reminded him of one of those etchings of the sea, with the curved lines of waves all laid out in alternating rows. \n“Are you L. Dreadful?” he asked the stranger.\n“No.”\n“Hmmm. Fought in the war, you said?”\n“Yes,” Spavens answered. \n“Which side?”\n“Both.” \nMerfield was silent, then laughed. “Now there's a story we could sell.\n“I've already sold subscriptions,” Malwise pressed. “Please, just take the new manuscript, read it...”\n“No,” the publisher answered. “Look, maybe after the real world Marco is dead, and his damned band of horse thieves aren't running around butchering respectable miners, lumberjacks, and railroad-men. Until then, it's too much of a risk.”\n“It can't be more of a risk than some of this other trash you sell,” Malwise said, picking up samples off the desk. Merfield grabbed them from his hands, anger flashing for the first time on his face. Then he smiled.\n“Do you like music?” he asked.\n“What?”\n“Marching tunes. I recently acquired a phonograph. Fro`m one of those mail order outfits, you know. I just arrived yesterday.” He cleared aside some papers to reveal a carved wooden box, to which he affixed a large copper speaking horn. He would a crank, and dropped a needle onto the slowly spinning plate. Horrible, screeching sounds filled the office, like the ghosts of tortured cats. He leaned closer to Malwise, nearly whispering in his ear. “Some Blinkertons came by today, asking about the Bandit stories. They kept asking who L. Dreadful was. You can see why I'm so worried.” \nSpavens was looking at them from the window, unable to follow the conversation. His mind felt confused, the sounds of the phonograph were reminding him of war. \n“What?” Malwise hissed. “What did you tell them?\n“Nothing. Practically nothing. I had to tell them about you...” the large man looked guilty. “I gave them your address.” No, Roger thought. My cousin. He turned and left the office, slamming the crooked door. Spavens started to follow, and Merfield gave him a burlap sack, filled with books. “Here,” he said, “I am sorry.” He stood for several minutes after they had left. That phonograph, he thought, was a waste of money.\nPinkertons\n\nRoger, Spavens, and Orlando return to Roger's cousin's house, to find it has been ransacked by Pinkertons. His cousin asks them to leave. \n\nRoger's cousin Penelope lived in a narrow street of brick town houses, their facades blackened by the drift-fuel burned in a factory blocks away, carriages and pedestrians jostling on the cobblestones. Laundry hung from the windows. Spavens, seeing the broken lock on the door, drew his revolver from its holster under his coat, with a surprising dexterity for someone with only one arm. Malwise noticed that, although without a weapon, Orlando's stance shifted, like that of a professional boxer. Perhaps he might be a good person to have protecting his daughter after all. The baby was crying inside, and a woman's voice, which Roger recognized as the maid, was speaking excitedly in a heavy, lower-class dialect. \nThey entered, and saw the room in shambles, but no one hurt. Penelope came and wrapped her arms around her cousin, then backed away looking at him with eyes rimmed with pink. “Roger, what did you do? Why were they here?”\n“I don't know,” he said. “When did they leave?”\n“Minutes ago.” \nSpavens, who had put his gun away, went to the window, pulling back the sun-faded flower patterned curtain. The window was stained with soot. Orlando had run to Zabella, who was looking more grim than frightened, and given her an embrace that lasted considerably longer than the one between the two cousins. \n“Look, Pen, I'm sorry...”\n“This girl,” Penelope said, “she says that she's your daughter?”\nFor a few long seconds no one spoke. When they had come earlier in the day, dropping off their bags before setting out to the publishers, Roger had floundered during the introduction, just saying that Spavens had come to Boston about a manuscript, and that Zabella was his grand-daughter. Penelope and her husband were religious (several gallows hung from the walls) , with strict morals, and Roger had been afraid that if his cousin found out the truth she wouldn't let them stay. He looked to Spavens for help, but the one-armed veteran had collapsed into an uncomfortable chair, and was staring at the wall. The sound of the baby crying reminded him of the war, and as often happened, he was becoming drowsy and confused. \n“I...I just found out myself today. I'm sorry.”\nThe maid, meanwhile, had taken the bag of books from where the old soldier had dropped it on the steps, placing it by their feet. She then took the crying baby into another room, trying with some success to stop its sobbing. Penelope sank into another chair, opposite from Spavens. Malwise tried to go to her, but she held up a hand. “No, Roger. I want you to go. They took all of your papers, your old sermons, and most of your books. I always believed you when you said you'd given up preaching heresy, but...we have a child, now. Things are hard enough. I want all of you gone before Charles comes home.”\nRoger nodded. It took him only a few minutes to pack his things into a battered canvas suitcase. Zabella grabbed her own small bag, along with the books, and then they were gone. “Pleased to meet you,” Zabella said as she left, with politeness unstained by any perceptible hint of bitterness. Penelope smiled before closing the broken door.\n\nAnother Train\nLater, on the train, Isabella wanted to talk about the utopian novel she had just read. It was an unauthorized sequel to Bergamy's Boston 2251, the leveler's manifesto that had become political gospel for a numerous clubs and reading groups. Over a dozen “responses” to the novel had been published, and L. Dreadful's Alternate Earth referred to them all, either directly or in footnotes. Bergamy had created a hypothetical world, including a futuristic Boston, where anti-gravity technology had never been developed! The ur-trees never existed, and so there had been no demand for slavery, no incentive for the upper classes to accumulate wealth and cast the rest of society in their shadow. The new world savages had been left in peace, and herds of wild buffalo still walked the prairies. The land wasn't scorched and burned by shadow-rails. Everything, in other words, was as the world could be, Bergamy's followers thought, if the nation's political system were just to return to earth and give up the industry of bending altitudes. \nOrlando, after the train chase, meeting Zabella's father, and then the business with the Blinkertons, was exhausted. The one-armed captain was sleeping next to them. The girl went on: “In Alternate Earth, though, the absence of any drift-producing trees or plants doesn't make any difference. There will still be wars and corruption, only expressed differently.” Isabella showed him one of the engravings, with the caption “A world that is flat: what might have happened.” \n“It's a little heavy-handed, don't you think?” Orlando yawned.\nFor Zabella, the trip seemed simply the reverse of arriving: it had been morning, then, and now it was night. The two strangers had been replaced with her father and Orlando, who she planned on marrying someday. Her father was reading one of the books he had gotten from Merfield. Spavens, next to them, was dreaming this:\nThe crossing flying rails of Chicago creating a perpetual cloud of occasional slaughter. Mangled humans fell down into the abattoirs and markets, the stock exchange where slaves were kept in shadow-jobs that shortened life-expectancy and made them hallucinate. They were in the ancient catacombs under the city, under the mausoleums and graveyards, with eldrich rodents and giant spiders. All of the city's victims fell down trap-doors and ended down there, with the thieves and zombies. They were headed back the way they came, following the sewers, and the train had caught fire, plunging down into the stars. They woke in the lair of godless assassins and cut-throat pianists and cello players. Then he woke and was on the train, with Orlando and Isabella talking about the leveler's utopia, then he fell asleep again.\nIt would be daytime when they arrived in Chicago. The rail lines were laid between alternating stations of natural grove and industrial construction. While up-root trees naturally rose during the day and fell at night, the coal-burning stations could be elevated or lowered more or less at will. Reversing the usual pattern, they were made to rise at night and settle back to earth during the day, along huge, tower-like spikes. In this way, with wooded stations placed between those of town or cities, the train cars could be moved along the tracks without the engines needing to burn much fuel themselves, propelled like ships along he waves of the sea. \nStudying the landscape barely visible in the dark beneath her, blotches of cleared homesteads in what was still mostly wilderness, Zabella found herself looking at the reflection, in the dirty window, of the man who was supposed to be her father. He yawned and closed the book. Spavens was snoring, and Orlando, slumped sideways, had covered his face with his hat. Malwise looked over at her, and smiled when he caught her eye. It was a scene that had been repeated several times over the last few hours. He seemed well intentioned, but why had her grandfather taken her across the country to meet him now?\nSpavens had made it seem that she would stay with him, but, unless she had misread the situation, he had just been kicked out of his home by his cousin. His clothes were shabby and his job, as he described it, wandering from city to city selling subscriptions for books, seemed uncertain. What were they going to do once the reached Chicago? Malwise had hinted that he had friends they could stay with, but would they really be any safer there than in California? If her father—the man she had thought, until a week ago, was her father, wanted to track them down, then he could do it anywhere. \nThe train rocked in a sudden wind, grating against the suspension cables, the rails under them swaying as the heavy machine sped through the sky. \nLily and the Bandit\n\nIt was over. Everything was finished, and she wasn't sure what would happen next. Her father and Zabella were gone. He, at least, had been honest with her, confirming her suspicions about the men that came to their house, when the tobacco smoke would drift up to her room along with their raised and brutal voices. He had been, honest, too, about the Henry's woman. To think, her husband had denied it, even in the same breath with which he had accused her of keeping secrets. So she had been writing stories! She had been glorifying the exploits of the bandits that her husband and the others were hunting down. She had known, all along, about his business, the stealing of their land, the real savagery in the name of progress that had caused so many men to turn to thievery and crime. Writing those stories had been her atonement, and her own revenge. For being forced to play a part, however small, in his evil schemes. \nThere would be no more writing. Her father had taken with him the last installment, that exposed everything. It was fiction, but enough would recognize the truth. Henry had taken her papers, her ink, everything but the bed and the damnable crochet. She could plunge those needles into her eyes, as in some grecian tragedy. She wanted to write, now, but not a story—she wanted to write a letter. She would explain everything to Roger, why she had never written back. She'd never actually seen the letters he had sent. It would have been too risky, even for someone like her father, who knew a thing or two about spying and keeping secrets. Instead, he had read them, and told her what they said. It was out of guilt, she always thought, for separating them so long ago. He was with Zabella now, he must be. What were they doing? \nShe had been sitting at her desk, tormented by the absence of her pen. She stood, paced on the rug of her room, and stared out the window at the trees. The owls were screeching back and forth. It was cold with the window open, but she liked to feel the air against her skin. She thought of Henry, shouting, shaking her by the shoulders, raising his fist...If only she had been able to have another child. He might not have hated Zabella so intensely, if she had given him a son or daughter of his own. He might not have needed to prove his manhood by acquiring such obscene amounts of wealth. What would he do when he learned that Zabella was gone? Would he suspect where she'd been sent? \nTired of pacing, but loath to lie in bed, Lily sank down onto the floor, dazzling her eyes with the chandelier. She hadn't eaten for quite some time. She wanted to walk out in the forest, but didn't have the energy, and was afraid she wouldn't have the courage to return. \nShe was relieved, elated, when she smelled the smoke. She didn't cry out. When the man broke through the door, she was laying flat on the carpet, and the bandit thought she had been overcome. What he didn't know is that she had been lying like that for hours, that she had been laying on the floor for hours out of every day, staring at the ceiling to avoid staring at the walls, not wanting the suffocating softness of the bed. \nThe hallway was in flames, the paint and paneling crackling with heat. The arsonist was wearing a large-brimmed hat and had mustaches roughly cut, his neck and arms dark and glistening with sweat. At some point she started screaming, but she didn't resist when he tossed a horse blanket around her and picked her up, carrying her easily across the doorway into the flames. The smell was rank, but not unpleasant, redolent of guns and unwashed clothes. She buried her face against his chest. Other men were shouting in Spanish, using words she didn't know. \n\"Wrap your arms around me,\" a taller man said, as she was lifted behind him on a strongly muscled horse. \"If you fall, bvbnnbn n bmyou'll break your neck. I for one will not be sorry.\" There were a half dozen of them, all wearing hats and long cloaks, armed with revolvers. When they were stuffing valuables from her house in sacks and tying them to the horses, they galloped off into the hills. She looked behind her once, watching a plume of smoke billow out of the burning manor. She held on tight to the bandit's waist.\n\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: INTANGIBLE ZONE\n\nFrom his one-man nest hanging high in the branches of a Kapok tree, Borqs looked out over one of the last remaining floating forests in the world. Within ten years, according to his computer models, it, too, would crash into the Earth. The unique urboreal ecology below, adapted to the up-root trees gravitational effects, would be smashed, and most of the other species that relied on the bio-chemical processes found only in floating habitats would go extinct. There would still be parks, perhaps, and zoos. From them, though, there would be nothing to learn. Already, the tops of the upper canopy were being bent into a crater-like declivity from the increasingly low nocturnal altitudes of the air-born island, inside the Intangible zone. Cities, airships, and flying cars had all swarmed the skies, while anything with natural buoyancy fell to earth. The 22nd century was witnessing the rise of the machines, and the collapse of life.\nA near-invisible net cocooned him from stinging insects, connected to sensors that recorded their landings, guessing their species based on weight, and making inferences from its counts as to populations. This data set was only one of many scrolling down the scientists' ghostly screens, the light of which, had they been real, would have biased the results. The only part of the phantasmic array that actually existed was the thin, transparent screen he held in his lap, with a photo-generative band along the top that beamed light directly into his pupils, causing the projections to appear. This screen, which sent small haptic shocks into his fingertips when he typed or made a selection, could be rolled up and fit into one of the many pockets of his camouflage vest. Everything else, the webbing and chords he'd used to make his temporary nest, the insect mesh, and the heavier clothes for later in the night or in case it rained, could be stuffed easily into his backpack. \nThe dying sun shot stiff curtains of light through the bars of the enormous trees. The same geo-engineering experiments of twenty years ago that had turned the skies around the globe a milky white had also robbed sunsets of some of their more vital and vivid shades, like clothes that had been washed too many times. His screen could have corrected this, sending more photons to stimulate the cones in his eye more responsible for perceiving blue, but the pale wash of colors suited his apocalyptic mood. \nUsually, field observations were made with teams of two or more, but tonight Naviyah had sent him out alone. He knew the reason why his behavior had rendered him too unbearable for anyone else to be around. Even for Borqs, whose natural state tipped towards misanthropic gloom (at least with in person interactions) he had lately been especially unfair and snappish towards the rest of the scientists. His gloominess, though, was what had launched his career. \nFrom his early teens, since the granny clouds had noticed his aptitude for history and science, Borqs had spent a considerable amount of time playing Futures, which, stripped of its more cosmetic elements, was a way for gamers to earn points by accurately predicting world events. The more specific and distant in time the predictions were, the more points it was possible to obtain. Borqs specialized in ecological collapse and climate change, and quickly rose in the ranks with a series of extremely pessimistic predictions about the fall of anti-gravitational habitats. Early on, he'd learned not to trust anything in the news, and rely instead on underground and scientific publications. His father's military service, along with his high scores on corpogovernmental tests, gave him access to sophisticated modeling software and tutoring programs in the cloud. The mistake most professional scientists made, he realized, and the trap he was able to avoid because he was an amateur no one took seriously, was in failing to see how the various fields, climatology, ecology, oceanography, glaciology, atmospheric science, population genetics and so on, all interacted and affected one another. Borqs focused his study on positive feedback loops—how the results of a disruptive environmental change would worsen the conditions causing for the change, leading to an exponential acceleration. Examples included the melting of the ice caps, leading to lower albedo or reflectivity in the oceans, in turn causing more ice to melt, with even less ice reflecting solar radiation, and more water absorbing it, starting the cycle over again. Or how exposed siberian tundra released stored carbon, warming the Earth, exposing more frozen tundra. Or how methane clathrates were released from the warming oceans, causing their temperature rise to accelerate. Or how his negative attitude, as Kamala had called it, lead to him alienating the other scientists, which led to his attitude becoming worse, and more alienation. \nFor Borqs, though, his deteriorating personal life was inextricably wedded with the worsening state of global biotic systems. Both were the same, and both were falling apart. BorQs was born in 2217, and was in his late thirties, when the temperatures started shooting up again, faster than before. The planet had a fever, and dreamt in hurricanes and cyclones. He was by then an evolutionary biologist specializing in urboreal (floating tree) ecologies, with a post-doctoral fellowship to study in the Amazon. The academic structure had become more modular, with a crowd-sourced network of semi-professional volunteers and scholars operating independently of state and corporate budgets. The traditional scientific establishment, hobbled by propaganda efforts, bureaucracy, and budgetary disputes, was finally recognizing it was being surpassed, in some areas, by the young techno-literate who had abandoned the system and quietly educated themselves. \nEveryone was trying to publish competing theories about the new warming: that it hadn't been the anti-gravity cities causing the warming at all. That it had been the flying cars and buildings, but the Earth had been in a periodic glaciation period, which was now ending. Or that the warming was linked to anti-gravity, but only indirectly, as the force responsible for destroying the ecosystems caught in the toxic shadow. Meanwhile, the people who wanted to know what was really going to happen were looking to games like Futures, and scientists like Borqs, who had all along ignored proprietary software with their algorithms compromised by political interest, and used only open source and transparently-coded programs.\nBorqs, his mind drifting away from the lists of species, tables, numbers, and graphs displayed around his cocoon, cleared the primary screen and held it up in front of his face, using it as a telescope, scanning the green mass of the canopy while there was still light. Following the tell-tale jostling of leaves, he found a small troop of spider monkeys, returning from a day of foraging and causing trouble. The computer tagged them automatically, recognizing the faces, even at this distance, of families they had seen before. The projectors built into the screen couldn't, without him looking directly through it, correct for the loss of light as the sun finally disappeared. For that, he had to switch to his lenses. \nSuppressing a twinge of guilt, after he had slipped on the light goggles he called up his hover-racing game, and let a randomization feature draw a small race-track looping through the trunks and vines in front of him, detecting and incorporating obstacles in the environment. \nAs the world became less livable, video games got better. Both things happened astonishingly quickly, over a period of years. An ecological depression was like an economic depression that never went away. There was a tipping point, and then a brief period of political and social chaos. Methane bubbles burped up from deep in the oceans, triggering a chain reaction of heat and die-off. Nuclear weapons would have been redundant. His father was a soldier, and had said no one could even follow who owned what battalions anymore, or who was holding what front for what reason. He died of cholera somewhere in Cambodia, far from enemy lines. Borqs' mother had told him then that they weren't moving anymore. \nGrowing up in the digital age, everyone had the game that they were attached to from childhood. It was a question frequently asked at parties, because no one could keep themselves from talking about it, and because it revealed more about who they were to strangers than they realized. Things about their personality, how much money their family had before the ecology collapsed, all could be unlocked with the cypher of their favorite fantasy world. \nFor Borqs it had been hover-car races. Looking through the archives at the research station, he had found old large-screen period relays of a Science Fiction series that started around his birth. He wondered if it might have been playing, his parents watching it, and some triangle-logic of attention formed, himself, older, as the gleaming racer, stepping out to accolades on some distant planetoid, a thin sphere of helmet barely visible, like a sign of grace.\nEverywhere he went online, he remembered, the granny-cloud had followed him. They weren't the ghosts of his ancestors, although they might as well have been. Unlike a lot of his friends growing up, he had accepted their presence as a necessary annoyance. In exchange for staying out of the Taboo areas, the granny-cloud fed him information, and acted as a direct relay to the evolutionary databases. \nHis family had moved all over the world, hiking through Siberian forests, riding dromedaries across the deserts of North Africa, and following the thin lateral bands of agriculture East, until they had ended up in South America. All of that landscape passing by, that he would never see again, and he had been playing games, always wearing his lenses. Both of his parents were originally from Ekin, one of the corporate brand-name states around what used to be Nepal. \nWhen the depression struck, and the storms started, his wife Kamala was working at a research center in Tibet, in the highest known grove of ur-trees in the world. Borqs was in the oldest—they were planning on co-writing a web-monograph. It was the first year they had been apart since their marriage. Then travel between cities, let alone continents, became impossible. \nHe had been given full access to the gaming database by the Granny-cloud on his thirteenth birthday. He had stayed up late, in a canvas tent in November. It was warm enough, they could almost sleep outside. He had about three hours of solar battery left. \n“I see you are interested in history,” the Granny-cloud said over the race-car's engine.\n“Not really,” he had said. BorQs was mad at the cloud, since it wasn't letting him play Zombie Cyborg.\nThe granny brought up into the corner of the ship's display replays of his latest races. Not the clips that he had chosen himself, but still shots seemed taken at random, catching strange things about his expression. I don't remember looking like that, he thought. The race-tracks were all recreations of 22nd century Earth. \n“It's a game,” almost-13 year old BorQs had said. “When you win a race, you advance through history. It's just environments. I'm not learning anything.” He sounded defensive.\n“Why do you want to play Zombie Cyborg?” A different voice asked. It was part of inter-corporate law that the women who volunteered to be part of the granny-cloud had to use their own voices. If a child under the cloud asked a difficult question, or showed signs of troubled behavior, one “granny” might switch to another in the Network. The new voice had an accent that could have been Australian, although they were speaking in Spanish. \n“The zombies are the good guys. It's so funny. It's set in the future, about a hundred years!” Had Borqs thought to check, he would know that the granny-cloud was automatically deactivated on a child's thirteenth birthday, and he would be able to enter any game he wanted to. He would also never be able to talk to the cloud again.\nThe entire hover-racing game was in the lenses. Often kids would construct their own cockpit out of cardboard or plastic surfaces that they could actually touch. The software could work just by mapping the hands. The 22nd century was his favorite because everything was on it's side. A lot of kids liked the 21st, where the race-tracks hung like spider-threads on the skyline. The temperature seemed cooler there, even in a simulation. \nBorqs, giving into a temptation he knew he should avoid, called his ex-wife. The delay of the signal gave the conversation a slow, chant like rhythm. He liked the sound of her voice, the phrasing like music they had figured out how to fit in around each other's words. She had a lover. He didn't at that time, but had in the four years since they had been separated by the falling curtain of desertification and internecine war. \nKamala asked him what he was doing, noticing his hands.\nHe laughed, “playing a game.”\n“Shouldn't you be working?” \n“I am. Spotting birds. I'm also piloting a hover-craft through...”\n“Through where?” his wife asked, looking bored.\n“Human attention is heightened by an orienting response. It's why television shows always had things flying at you, as if just missing. I can notice more birds when my eyes are also moving around the field looking at race-track landscapes...”\nShe looked away. “I'm also looking at you,” he said.\n“You're trying to do too many things at once. I've got to go.” Before switching off, she said:\n“You shouldn't call me like this anymore.”\n\nScap \n\nScap's airbus was kept in the air by luck and desperation, the angry rattle in the engine, like a smoker's cough, working at the young courier's mind, warning him of stalling, plummeting, death. When possible, he hooked onto the guide-wires, both for the safety and the slight margin of efficiency creaking along the cables provided. Lights within the thick wires pulsed softly, warning away the faster, more expensive crafts dropping down from the upper lanes. Hearing a rough gargling sigh that shook the frame of the vehicle, Scap went through a small series of superstitious gestures, tapping the dashboard with his little finger, turning the radio off and back on, and cooing to the car like a lover. Blinking his right eye, then his left, he switched through settings on his lenses, turning the vehicle transparent, then into a wire-frame model swimming with labels and diagnostic data. He had intentionally chosen a model that could be worked on by open-source mechanics, rather than one of the sealed-box types that, while higher quality, could only be worked on by Capital's suits. Remny, a friend of a friend who knew engines, had done all he could to save the dying car over the last few months and several visits, but Scap knew that the era of the lime-colored air-bus was nearing its final days. When it finally succumbed to the entropic forces of slow destruction innate to all mechanical objects, the vehicle would end up repurposed, torn apart and converted into a domicile for slum-dwellers or as raw material for some Maker's robotic art. It's machine parts would be decomposed and returned to the glass, metal, and plastic ecology of the energy-starved city. \nAlready, the bus was easing its way into a stationary existence, spending long stints as a modular attachment for whatever concern needed the seats, space, or haphazard collection of equipment and supplies that he carried. A week before he had parked it next to a low-scale hanging restaurant whose air conditioning system had stopped working, providing temporary cooling as well as an extra table. It was a bigger vehicle, of course, than Scap would have wanted for himself, but he appreciated how it connected him to the city, and the network of like-minded transients and hackers. He didn't own it, but leased it from a nebulous co-op, the details and finances of which were largely managed by computers, directing the members as to where their resources could be used most efficiently. He could watch the ID tag of his vehicle on the cloud as its user-based ratings were adjusted, as intelligent bystanders listened to its aging muffler and reported their diagnosis, betting on how long the engine would last. If they guessed correctly, their own ratings and community credit would incrementally increase. Scap was a small part in the ever-shifting human and physical architectures of the city, drifting along lines drawn by necessity, chance, or some deeper, inscrutable logic of Megalopolis itself. Energy shortages meant that the motility of domiciles and vehicles had to be maximally efficient, each relocation cleared or conducted by the municipal and free cloud-sets. \nAs he got lower, he saw below him clean, tree-lined streets and pools of clear water, but this was only the filter Lyon was feeding into his lenses. Usually, what inhabitants of Lyon saw was a combination of what they needed to be able to perceive, in order to actually navigate and carry out their business, and what Capital wanted them to perceive. The less sightly parts of the floating metropolis were smoothed over, touched up, and replaced, as long as fooling traveler's vision wouldn't actually put them in any danger, or cause them to miss their destination. Every year, the laws regarding what was permissible to deceive citizens' eyes into seeing became a little more lax, while at the same time the hackers got a little better and circumventing the commercial and cosmetic visions. Where Scap was headed, though, was barely acknowledged as a destination at all by the Municipality, so the commercial interference was thick and largely unregulated, and he had to drop lower and lower before the imaginary landscape began to shimmer and disappear, and the actual city take grimy shape below him. The dinginess of the falling, propped-up offices and derelict neighborhoods emerged from the soup of shared hallucinations, filled with advertisements and subtle messages of propaganda. In the same way, Scap thought, the meds, supplied by the same banks, controlled the perceptual filters of the mind. Capital and its sub-corp Ginqualons controlled, or tried to control, the vision of its citizens as much as was humanly possible, without causing actual death or dementia. \nEverything, Scap thought as he dropped the mini-bus down to one of the lower, semi-secret rails, through clouds of fake, non-existent trees and buildings, depends on managing information. He took the kind of pills that he took because he could hack the dispensary data, and knew how to forge and manipulate prescriptions, and had easy access to the black market. He was a courier, an immigrant, someone with hardly any formal education, but an intuitive sense of how to interact with municipal systems. It seemed like he had nothing, but he had friends. He could hang his bus under a thousand homes in the city and have a couch to sleep on. Everything came down to the choice between corporate, managed goods and services and the grey market of time-sharing, smuggling, and improvisation. An unstable, brutal, reality, or the comforting fever-dream of a dying corporate empire.\nHe needed some help, a little boost, before dropping down into the junk-yard of the Makers, and took a small pill from one of the nooks in the dashboard, popping it into his mouth, sucking water from a straw that hung down from the roof of the vehicle. Here we go, he thought. Scap actually took less drugs than the majority of Lyon, but he and the other hackers faced the difficult knowledge and responsibilities that came with self-medication. If he allowed the hospital systems to determine his intake, as was the legal and far more common option, then the psychotropic underpinnings of his day-to-day life would be hidden, fading into the background like the thousands of ways the lenses brightened colors, blurred eye-sores, and softened the edges of the city, directing his eyes to attractive and approved points of focus. He could pretend that the way he felt was natural. As the mild opiate and stimulant snaked into his nervous system, though, he was faced with the familiar, uncomfortable knowledge that the way he felt was artificial. The world as he saw it now, the chaos of the junkyard glowing with interest, begging to be observed and meditated upon, was a realm that existed behind the one that he usually saw through his apathy and mild depression, on the other side of a door that he could open whenever he wished, by taking one of the smuggled pills.\nFor the courier, who didn't think of himself as a philosopher, or even very intelligent, he would not have phrased his intuition in the way that I have chosen to. Already, though, his mind was beginning to absorb thoughts from the Drift, barely his, the result of half-remembered visions that he mistook for dreams or the effects of narcotics. I was already beginning to infiltrate his mind, which is how I am able to tell his story.\nNames popped up in his lenses, as Scap knew his would in theirs. For those he focused on, blinking and twitching his fingers, holding his thumb against the first knuckle of his index finger to activate the controls, thin lines appeared in his vision, which he could follow to make contact. He took out an earpiece and put it in, cycling through greetings and invitations. It was a party, but like most of the gatherings of his tribe of non-commercials, it was also a chance to make transactions and learn about opportunities, business blending seamlessly into the social. \nThere was music, but music had long ago evolved from single sources of sound. Stages with central sets of speakers had been replaced by distributed nodes of melody and rhythm, fed by the votes and dancing of the roaming crowd, who could take a beat or loop from one location and “carry” it somewhere else. A singer might climb onto a stack of scrapped appliances and start belting out lyrics, which then might be amplified by listeners, or tuned out through the earpieces or, in some sections with the necessary equipment, by directed speakers that canceled out the waves in the air itself. \nScap wandered through the reconstituted wreckage, making his own modifications to the sound, until he had built up something resembling a song he was happy with, and sent it out into the global cloud. There was no copyright, no single source of authorship or definitive record or performance. Corporations like Ginqualons had a music industry, while the nomad-hackers just had music. BorQs, recording the movements of parrot flocks in the Amazon, heard the song that Scap transmitted, although by the time it reached him it had been modified, mixed, and added to. They were “friends” in the sense that they were circumscribed often by the same circles of games and information. Their data, such as it was, was mutually available, because they shared common causes and interests. \nAfter the sun went down, Scap and most of the others went underground, into the sub-basements and cellars abandoned by the city and reclaimed by transients. Setting his lenses to a common channel, Scap looked up and saw the ceiling disappear, along with the corroded skyline that would have been visible beyond it. The space was filled with unpolluted stars. Although most of the vision-feeds were anonymous, or so collaborative as to make attribution impossible, occasionally particularly impressive displays bore the artist's or coder's tag, and in this case after a little digging Scap found a handle, and followed the trail his lenses offered through the throng of dancers until he found her, a small, short-haired woman covered in thick and fanciful visuals: fish-scales and streaming banners of color that floated weightless around her head, like jelly-fish tendrils, each of them bearing addresses in the cloud. She saw him looking at her and smiled, twitching her fingers in a way that Scap knew meant she had turned down the ambient noise. He did the same, and the music dropped to a decibel level over which they could easily talk. \n“I like your stars,” Scap said. \n“Thanks,” the girl answered. She looked to be around Scap's age, still in her teens. Her forehead creased in concentration for a few seconds as she, most likely, scanned through his profile data. Scap, keying onto her signal, made more of it available, opening up a channel between them as a sign of trust. In return, she pointed up to one of the streamers, which started to glow faintly.\n“There's another project I've been working on, with some of my friends,” she said. “We were going to wait until later, but I think we could start it now, if you wanted to see it...” \nScap did. They took an elevator platform up, and then he followed Saye (that was the girl's name) to a bike-hub, where pseudo-electric cycles were charging around a flower-shaped lock, which opened when they approached. The two of them, along with a small group of half of a dozen friends, took the cycles and began to follow the illuminated path the navigation system traced on their lenses. More people joined them, all of which seemed to know Saye, and most of which shot curious or friendly glances at Scap, some of them blinking rapidly and twitching their fingers in the tell-tale signs of retrieving data. They would return the bikes to another lock elsewhere in the city, the locks themselves movable depending on calculations of traffic and use—algorithms similar to those Scap was familiar with from flying his bus. \nThey got to the edge of the floating city, where barriers of red light began trying to interdict their passage, but the group, growing larger with every block, rode past them. Scap checked his location on the municipal system, just to be sure, and as he suspected saw that according to the city's trackers he and the cycle had stopped at the edge of the legal area. He began to like Saye and her group of friends more and more. Then, once they reached the area where the crumbling periphery really did start to get dangerous, they parked their bikes on a flat ledge that used to be a foundation. The city, as it grew over the last few hundred years, actually shrank in size, the edges crumbling and falling away, the material scavenged to build upwards, trying to meet the upper classes' need for altitude, sections floating above sections, pressing down on those below them with apergenetic radiation. What used to be a plateau, with a V-shaped mass of rock and vines below it, was now more diamond-shaped, with a pyramid of high-rises and oil-feuled shelves scrambling for position at the top. Like most of the world's floating cities, the physical structures themselves had become a symbol for the unequal, top-down societies that had created them. \nThe small group spent some time milling around, rubbing their hands against the cold, laughing, careful not to fall in the dark. Saye and a few others sat down on some broken plinths of concrete and began some serious interface work, moving their fingers and staring at “screens” he knew must be hovering somewhere in front of them, where their gazes were fixed. Not knowing any of the others, but not wanting to interrupt what Saye was doing, Scap hovered uncomfortably around them, still toying half-heartedly with some of the melodic fragments he had collected earlier. Having pity on him, Saye returned his earlier favor and gave him a gate into their data-stream, the screen they were staring at becoming visible, a scrolling map of codes and images. It was some kind of modelling program, and Scap recognized various representations of the city, swarmed with numbers and arrows. He couldn't guess what kind of a performance they were planning. Soon, though, Saye stood up and walked over to where he was standing, looking down at the Earth far below them. They had a clear view of the surface, the scorched launch-pad circle created by the anti-gravitational field, and he assumed that was why they were here, to be able to see over the edge of the city, but Saye turned him around, to look at the stacked shelves and skyscrapers of Megalopolis, hovering over Lyon like it did over every other urban center, a reminder of Capital's ubiquity and power.. \n“Are you ready?” she asked. The jelly-fish banners from her head were gone, along with many of her other accoutrements, and she was left looking rather normal, if attractive in a silver shirt and pants like a suit of chain-mail. Indicators on his lenses lit up, telling him that his normal perception-stream was being over-rided, and the midnight sky began to brighten, like the lights coming up in a theater. Then, as he watched in fascinated terror, Megalopolis began, slowly, to collapse.\n\nObservations in the Forest\n\nThe bicycles sped down what used to be an old logging road, the thick tires cushioning the worst of the pot-holes and rocks. Laoshe and Taben, the two young interns, shot ahead recklessly, and Sushma let them go, sensing they might want to be alone. The air-boat with the other Scientists had dropped them off at the point from which they could easily coast down to the research station. The interns, just kids really, made a habit of using the bikes whenever they had an excuse, and the breaking on this downhill run would charge the small batteries built into the frames. Sushma couldn't blame them. After a day of exhausting mental work, a small amount of physical stimulation and exercise could go a long way in recharging their own, human batteries as well.\nNo one became a scientist in order to make money. Even after the ecological collapse, when fields like biology and climatology became, arguably, the most important professions in the world, there were still too many people wanting to do them, and too little money to pay for research. The only reason anyone went through the grueling process of entering into ecological research was because they loved being outside, in what few natural habitats the Earth still had left. It was only natural that they would spend every moment they could out in the forest. Even when it started to rain, she didn't regret her decision to take the bikes back to the base camp, and from the glimpses she caught of the two younger scientists, laughing and splashing each other with puddles, she knew that they didn't either. It was warm, and the rain, at least, meant there would be no mosquitoes. \n“Be careful!” Laoshe said to Taben, who was going too fast, trying to show off. If they broke their leg here, there would be no way for them to get to the hospital. With the political and environmental chaos that had enveloped the continent, probably the world, there was no way they were going anywhere soon. As much faith as she put in indigenous medicine, and the ability of Edira and the others to extract remedies from the forest, she didn't want to test their skills on a compound fracture. She put on the brakes, coming to a halt. Their semester-long internship had turned into a year and a half. The rain forest, though, was the best place she could be, and probably one of the safest. Risks of monsoons, spider-bites, and deadly falls aside, at least she wouldn't get shot by rioters or corporate militias. Seeing that Taben had stopped, she coasted down to him and braked again. \n“Let's wait for Sushma.”\n“Okay,” he said, and kissed her. \nThe senior researcher appeared a moment later, her stout body balanced with stately grace on the bicycle, her bright, loose-fitting clothes dotted with mud thrown up from the tires. \n“What are you waiting for?” She said. “I'm hungry.” The rain had stopped, one of the brief showers that was a common, almost daily occurrence in the forest. Bromeliads had filled their cups, and thick drops slid off the leaves of palms, and made spider webs more visible. \nThey got back to the research station just as the dusk was making the trail more dangerous, although they knew it well enough they probably could have rode it in the dark. The laboratory was made half of light-weight rods and clear plastics, and half from materials they had gathered from the surrounding environment, leafy fronds covering some of the roofs, and branches standing in as posts for some of the extensions. The combination gave it a kind of neo-primitive look, both blending in and standing out from the forest. The shelter was entirely modular, and could be taken down, moved, or reinforced for high winds within a number of hours. The bridges, cots, and corridors could be replaced by plant fibers harvested from a ten-kilometer radius. In the past year and a half they had moved it several times, fitting the computers and components in the air-boat, which was now resting on the canopy nearby, like some kind of a gigantic manta-ray. \nThere was a distinctive smell to the research station, a not unpleasant mix of the combined scents of human perspiration and other olfactory signtures of their existence, the earthy odor of their carved wooden furniture combining oddly with the charged electrical tang of their equipment, and the damp, fecund air of the forest coming through the windows. The only light came from the dim glow of the solar torches, the last of their diesel reserved for cooking and the computers. \nGrislin, an older professor whose remaining hair he had let grow long in a ring around the base of his scalp, was in charge of dinner, a chore that they rotated, but, like most, tended to fall more frequently, by unspoken agreement, on those who did it best. As usual, there were both vegetarian and meat dishes, fish that had been caught from the river, despite the fact that this was technically illegal. In between bites of food and companionable silence (or rather, companionable listening to the sounds of birds and light rain, which had started again, outside) they traded bits of bad news about the outside world, and complaints about their work. Naviyah and Pico weren't back yet, and Borqs, thankfully, was off on some solo observations near the zone. Even when the remains of the meal were spread out on the table, they were reluctant to end their conversations, which seemed to just be getting started.\n“The whole reserve is going to be opened up,” Grislin was saying. “There's no way other nations are going to pay the...the ransom Peru is demanding not to blast and bulldoze.”\n“It has to be a bluff,” Laoshe said. “If they hand the zone over to the multinats then there's nothing else to bargain with. The fact that it's untouched is what makes it valuable. Besides, it's not like the crisis is an energy shortage, it's a shortage of life. They have to see that the reserve has more ecological than resource value. \nGrislin shook his head. “The life shortage, as you call it, is mostly perceived as a shortage of food. Hundreds of millions are dying of famine, and the corporate governments think that the only way to feed people is by using more energy for fertilizer, irrigation, and so on.”\n“It's another one of Borq's damn feedback loops,” Taben said, snorting. Even when he wasn't there, the computer modeler's pessimism could cast a pall around the table. \nGrislin suddenly grinned. As proxy chef for the evening, it was his prerogative to decide if, or when, to break out the Pisco. At the suggestion, unanimity quickly arose in favor of the proposal. The others followed him into the small kitchen, carrying plates and dishes. “If they do open up the reserve, I think we should go inside,” he said, taking out the glasses. \n“You know what Naviye would say about that,” Laoshe replied. “The idea of the zone's intangibility, the sacrosanct nature of its inviolability, is the only thing keeping it from being destroyed. If anyone, including us violates—what does she call it?—the taboo, then the groves will fall. The only natural urboreal habitat left on Earth will go extinct.”\nOnce they were back at the table, the glasses of clear liquid in front of them, the conversation resumed. “But Chang already went into the zone,” Grislin said. “Twenty years ago.” \n“He was a renegade,” Laoshe said, “and now he's in jail.” \n“Still,” Grislin persisted, “who would ever know? We could stage our own deaths, and live happily ever after as savages in paradise as the rest of the world goes to hell.” He finished his glass and poured another. \n\nMEGALOPOLIS\n\n\nAbove every major city was another city, looming above it in lens-space. The Capital: the megalopolis that had grown so large, and risen high enough in power and importance, that its phantom clones now cast their shadows over dozens of urban centers. Only the very poor or very rich worked in the physical cities where they actually lived. The jobless and homeless traveled from neighborhood to neighborhood, trading seeds, cheap lenses, and digital relics. Only the city's elite had physical office-space. Everyone else worked from home, sending their avatars to Megalopolis. \nMegalopolis didn't actually exist, at least not this version of it. Faced with the impossibility of maintaining its standards of opulence, Capital Industries simply used the exiting scans of its air-born megacity and created a holographic version, unconstrained by gravitational or spatial laws. It was, as the CEO lovingly joked, a “work”-space. \nThe Captital, or Megalopolis, despite its virtual nature, was nonetheless a reality for the numberless workers around the world who spent the majority of their working hours in it confines and cubicles. Christope Pierrot, Saye's father, was one of them. Here is how a typical weekday for Christope, began: he would wake up, have breakfast with his wife, Sing, and then they would then go into separate work rooms, or offices. He would then either sit at his desk, or step up into the omni-directional treadmill, depending on his mood. He would either wear lenses or choose to have photon streams beamed directly into his eyes.\nProfessionals, along with anyone under the age of 30, were used to navigating between the consensual and individual realities: the world experienced by their physical bodies, and that seen through the lenses (real or metaphorical). Workers in Megalopolis were able to decorate their home office however they liked: it was completely scanned, and duplicated somewhere in the expanding geography of the virtual capital. \nFor the sake of verisimilitude, employees were required to go through a fifteen minute cable-car ride into the upper city. The real, lower level structures looked like they were on crutches. Hastily constructed stilts and scaffolding failed to compensate for the shortage of drift-feul needed to create the counter-gravitational fields. Several earthquakes had already toppled most of the expansion age structures. Masses of inhabitants in the lower cities had no choice but to flee the crumbling structures.\nLyon had already earned the name \"post-expansion\" on account of its collapsing architecture behind a thin technological facade. \"Post-expansionism\" (the term reminiscent of the early 21st century, which had briefly decided that it was \"post\" just about everything. In this case, though, the term made sense). \nAfter the 15 minute ride up to the billboard-laden hallucinatory space of the transport station, the dual citizen, while sitting at home in Bangkok or Des Moines, would also be part of a dense international hub of commerce. Christope would be among them, with a break for lunch (two more funicular rides), until six, when he was forced to endure another pointless multi-media barrage, while his wife also waited, on the other side of their shared wall. The mandatory time spent in the cable-cars, Cristope had heard, had been determined by psychologists as a necessary and healthy buffer between the mental space of work and that of home, a chance to make the transition from the fully virtual to the merely mediated. Saye, his daughter, often cynically told him that it was merely an opportunity for Capital to inflict on them advertising and propaganda. She was in her first year of college in the Capital, studying virtual art, and already thought she knew everything. The billboards floating in the air below them, and flickering in the windows, were distracting, but he did find the view of the real city, gradually growing larger beneath him, relaxing. The news programs had relatively few commercials, and seemed to keep him well enough informed on local happenings and world events, which is why he was skeptical when, over lunch, Saye told him that there was a virus spreading across the globe. \n“It makes people unable to read or write?” he joked. “That's not really going to change much then, is it?”\n“You don't understand,” his daughter said, throwing up several articles onto the walls in their shared scratch-space. “Once this goes pandemic everything is going to start to fall apart. It may seem like everything is voice-command and visual icons, but underneath all that someone has to be able to manage the coding.” Christope put his lenses on to read the articles she was pointing to. The sites didn't look reputable, most of them just posts on forums or text-feeds with few pictures, and no logos that he recognized. \nSaye's mother walked in, and seeing their expressions, asked what she had missed. Cristope told her that there was apparently a mind-virus on the loose causing rampant illiteracy. Sing said she had heard something about that, but had assumed it was a hoax. “It is a hoax. There was nothing about it on the newscast.” Cristope went to get her sandwich from the kitchen, calling back to ask what she wanted to drink. Saye tried to get her to look at the links she put on the walls but she rubbed her eyes, saying she wanted a break from the lenses, so Saye explained them to her, reading parts out loud. \n“Okay, worst case scenario, there's always voice-to-text.” Sing was more understanding than her husband, but her daughter still knew she wasn't taking it seriously. \n“That might work at first, for a little while, but without the ability to read the transcriptions, errors will keep in. Everything that needs updated, entered, fixed, no one will be able to maintain. The generators and gravitation systems for the city will fail. The shelves are going to collapse onto one another. We need to leave the city.”\n“This sounds like one of your...art projects.”\nSaye had gone back into her room, resisting the urge to slam the door, leaving her parents to clean the table. Bad manners, but she wanted to read as much about the virus as she could before had to go back up to the University—what was quickly becoming the university, with hundreds of millions of students sitting in the same multi-layered auditorium halls, listening to the same Capital professors, taking the same exams. Her real education, of course, was on the Global networks. She'd learned, like everyone else her age, how to block out the Capital feeds on the mandatory cable-ride, and hack the firewalls that kept students from opening up other screens or chats during classes. \nWhen the lunch break was over, though, a message showed up saying that there were problems with the University's rendering software, and the afternoon session was being canceled for maintenance. She went back out into the hall, and say her father and mother in the living room. “Do you believe me now?” She asked. Opening up the glass doors to their small balcony, she looked up at the megalopolis, and first the first time in her life, she saw the city over the city flicker, glitching like a cheap, pirated game environment.\nNew Species\n\nNaviyeh sat somewhere between sleeping and waking, as the boat glided on the snake-like river between the dark water and the stars. Pico's paddling was rhythmic and even, his steering as sure as it would have been if it were the middle of the day. They had spent the night in one of the research posts on the bank, little more than a hut on stilts. They had heard otters splashing in the shallows, and panthers screaming with eerie voices that could have been human. She had been up most of the night, checking data from the gauges and cameras, letting the forest talk to her in graphs and numbers while Pico slept. It seemed she had just closed her eyes for a moment, when she found herself on the cot, with the old Peruvian making tea. \nThe technological devices and scientific knowledge necessary to study and understand natural systems seemed to be advancing at the same historical moment the systems themselves were in decline. The human species was learning how to really see the world just in time to watch it collapse, and to appreciate what they were losing. She could almost see a logic to it, a balance. The explosion of human culture and information at the cost of poison, extinction, and die-offs for the rest of the biosphere. Naviyeh wondered if there wasn't an entropic limit for all evolutionary systems, and complexity in one area was always going to be balanced by blind-sidedness on another. Solutions to previous questions asked by natural or cultural selection provided no adaptive fitness in a new ecological landscape, like one several degrees warmer. The surviving populations, governments, and political structures seemingly put a lot of progressive philosophies of human social development to rest. \nEvolution at a species level hadn't selected the most enlightened. The losers and winners of the ecological depression weren't determined by any kind of meretricious behavior, or even any particular trait like brutality, cunning, military or mercantile authority. It had just been random. In the vacuum left by the attritions in the 2240's, the favored adaptations seemed chosen for no reason, or for reasons no one predicted. No one had anticipated the importance of Ur-trees after the second wave of global storms, how something about them dissipated heat and radiation. Even the shadow of apergenetic plants, that had been so feared in the late 19th century, seemed designed to provide shade and shelter from the sun. It's constantly dripping aquifers could provide irrigation for crops resistant to its effects. The increased gravity underneath the groves also prevented erosion. \nNaviyeh was sipping on ur-leaf tea, quite used to its effects. It was pre-dawn, mist rising as if raining in reverse. When you are young, she thought, you use science to tell the world about yourself. When you are old, you use it to tell yourself about the world. In the end, everything turned out to be random. She had worked her entire life for grant money, connections and co-publications with some of the best minds in her sub-specialty, only to end up trapped in South America at the end of the world with a research team of interns. The smartest one at the station, barring herself, was the old Peruvian paddling the canoe, who seemed to be about 100 years old, and spoke Spanish and Portugese with a strange accent, always talking around ur-tree leaves. \nThey had him doing menial jobs, when she asked him to help her collect beetles, and noticed how he classified them in baskets. In the end, intelligence had turned out to matter as little as anything else in determining the new landscape of the die-off. Like generals, species were always fighting previous wars, not the present one. The selective criteria of the next collapse was always something no one could anticipate. The inter-related data-clouds that would last as long as satellites were like those huge ships of seeds sank off the coast of warming Siberia, to start floating out in six thousand years. With access to the right interface equipment, anyone could carry out research. So why did she obsess so much about the records of everyone she worked with, and remain so fascinated by Pico's complete lack of them?\nMaybe she was in love with a hundred year old man. When she was around him, she saw things differently, could follow his gaze from one plant to another and sense relationships. She was nearly that old herself, judging by how she felt this early in the morning. Why, then, hadn't she named him chief researcher, and listed him on the papers she sent into the networks? Because he didn't have a surname. He was illiterate. Any number of reasons. \nNaviyeh realized that the sound of the paddles dipping into the water had stopped. She turned to look back at Pico, who was squinting intently at something in the slowly dawning sky. “What is it?” She asked, trying to follow his gaze, but only able to make out the rough layers of horizontal silhouettes of landscape, smeared by the rising mist coming off the land and river. Heat differentials, she thought, Intermediate zones of physical states, like her own groggy navigation between dreaming and alertness, her brain waves struggling to shorten. \nPico pointed with a dark, thin arm and finger. “That grove, number six, the one we rigged up last week. It's moving, heading towards the zone.” Naviyeh wanted to say that wasn't possible, or to ask him if he was sure. With anyone else, she might have, but Pico would have thought carefully before he spoke. Instead, she dug her screen out of the water-proof pack, unrolled it, and called Borqs. The scientists at the station, she knew, would still be sleeping, but she had a feeling tat the computer modeler would be up. He was, packed up from where he had slept, the rappel ropes already set. His eyes were puffy but alert, his long hair, as usual, pulled back and tied behind his head. \n“Borqs, I need you to check the position of post six.”\n“I was getting some strange readings from the zone last night, near the biggest groves,” he said, his eyes off screen as he pulled up the data. “There's something else. News from the cloud that seems like a hoax, but there's enough sources now that...Woah,” Borqs said, interrupting himself. “Six is moving. Heading towards the edge of the zone.”\n“Can you get there?”\n“I can try,” he said, excitement in his voice. “Switching to audio.” \nThe image of him disappeared, replaced by rough scratching sounds as he fitted an ear-piece into place. \nNineveh switched to video from the camera they had set up in the grove, feeling an odd disorientation watching the trees emerging from the screen display move by at the same time that Pico, with a strength in his arms and back remarkable for his age, was rowing them along the river. The grove, too, was following a channel of water, one of the smaller tributaries that skirted the zone. As the sun rose, it was gaining height. She saw a flock of green parrots flying in spiral paths around the up-root trees, with a synchronization that struck her as odd, too tightly choreographed for normal flocking behavior. Butterflies were perched on a branch not far from the camera, seeming to fold and unfold their wings in sequence. Hadn't she noticed something strange the night before, in the pre-dawn sky above the zone, an odd glow or trick of light that she had dismissed as an after-image from staring at her holographic screen to long? \nShe tried to contact the research station but something was wrong with the satellite link. Instead, she recorded a message: “Pico and I have discovered anomalous movement from the grove at observation point six, moving without wind towards the intangible zone. Probably the falling of one of the up-root trees, or some kind of shifting of internal mass is responsible. We can't let our observation equipment enter the intangible zone. Keeping to inter-corporate law on protected habitats is the only thing that gives this facility any legitimacy in the world. We need to make sure when the grove goes past that line, there is nothing there the natives can use to learn about us. Borqs is on his way, and will probably reach the grove before us. If by some chance we don't get there in time, do not access any of the video feeds after it passes into the territory. We can shut the cameras down remotely.”\nThe intangible zone was, apart from the bottom of the oceans, the only place on Earth that hadn't been surveilled, scanned, and mapped with satellites. The idea was that even knowing the extent of the resources available within might prove too strong of a temptation, so despite the tremendous wealth of scientific knowledge that could have been gained from fly-overs or remote monitoring, Borq's tree-post was the closest anyone ever got to seeing inside the zone. Even from that distance, though, the tops of tremendous floating groves were visible, larger by orders of magnitude than any left on earth, even in the Himalayas. There had been theories in the scientific community about groves exerting some kind of attraction, which, some believed, was the only way to account for the size of the up-root aggregate forests that had been reported in the Americas, before the trees were harvested and the great groves fell to the earth, replaced by steam-and coal powered substitutes. \nThey reached the side-branch in the river, nearly hidden by shadows, that would take them to where the grove was heading. Their passage disturbed alligators from the mud on the banks, who slid into the murky water, only their eyes and snouts left visible. \n“I'm here,” Borqs' voice said, appearing also in the display on her screen. “The grove is caught in some trees by the bank, but I doubt if they will hold. I'm going to try to secure it with rope.” \n“Be careful,” Naviyeh said. An unusual number of parrots seemed to follow them along the tree-line. It was daylight, now, and out of the shade she found herself getting hot, and took off her jacket. The display on her screen flickered and collapsed, the connection closed. She rolled it up and stuck it in her pack, the actual grove coming into sight ahead of them. They saw that Borqs had managed to keep it from pressing any farther into the forest, lodged a short distance from the bank, although some of the trees to which it had been secured were bending with the strain. Pico tied the boat to a massive tree that had fallen into the river, and they used the trunk as a bridge to take them to the bank. She tried to get Borqs on the ear-piece, but heard only static. \nHe had left two ropes for them, and they quickly fixed their harnesses and ascenders, Naviyeh going first, slapping branches from her face as she ran the motorized winch as fast as she dared. The shadows of the groves gave her the same strange feeling they always did, as if her existence were shearing off into a smear, like when you moved your hand too quickly in front of your face. The air was thick with flowers and decay. She felt the slight resistance from the inverted gravity field. All of the researcher's arms were shaped like body-builders from pulling themselves through apergenetic fields. \nNaviyeh was half-way up when she noticed that the other guide rope had stopped bouncing. Pico wasn't moving. Twisting her body in the harness and looking down, she saw him staring at the flock of birds at the same time she heard the noise. Twisting again, she looked above her and saw the bright signaling colors of the heads and wings, diving in and out as if they were trying to weave visual impressions into some kind of rainbow fabric. There were also...sea turtles. Flying, their undersides glowing with some kind of internal parasite that allowed them to fly. A new species. She made sure her lenses were off, afraid of some kind of trick. Dancing in the middle of them was a school of a dozen octopus. They started climbing again, silent.\nWhen Naviyeh pulled herself over the tangled, root-covered edge of the small grove, impatiently unhooking herself from the ropes, one of the largest turtles had landed in front of Borqs and was staring up at him, blinking. He was grinning up at the air-born sea-creatures floating above him, among the multi-colored flocks of birds. \n“New species,” he said, when they got close to him. “Hundreds of them. They've been coming out of the zone for the past half hour.” Enormous flocks of parrots were drawing long, looping spirals from the distant groves in the zone, like three-dimensional calligraphy drawn into the sky. The wind was picking up, rocking the island as if trying to free it from the ropes that Borqs had tied, bringing strange smells on the heavy breeze. More sea-turtles, their dorsal flippers flattened out until they looked like wings, luminescent with whatever allowed them to fly, had landed in a semi-circle around them, like a delegation. Over-sized jelly-fish danced behind them. \n“I think...” Borqs said softly, looking at Naviyeh and Pico, “I think they are intelligent.”\nWe need to record this, Naviyeh thought, digging the screen from her pack and unrolling it. “Have you contacted the station?” she asked. Looking at the familiar display, something odd seemed to happen to her eyes as they tried to fix on the names of the programs she needed to open. She could see the familiar menu, the shapes of the words and letters, but they made no sense. \n“That is the other thing. What I was going to tell you before.” Borqs looked from her, blinking in confusion at the screen, back up to the dancing swarm of life in front of them. “Last night, there was this news that broke in the cloud. I thought it was a hoax, even when it was verified by sources I could trust, that I should have trusted. There's some kind of pandemic. A virus. It doesn't kill you, or even make you sick.” Naviyeh stared at him, then at the turtles, then at the swimming, impossible surface of the screen. “You just can't read or write anymore. Within hours, it will be everywhere on Earth.” \nNaviyeh glanced down in panic at her open pack, by the handle, where the name of the research station had been written in large, block letters, now alien, inscrutable, and obscure. Borqs held out his hand, and one of the green parrots flapped down to land on it, gently gripping the skin, tilting its head in curiosity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: BLOODLESS AGE\n\nThe collapse of megalopolis that Scap watched, that inevitable gut-wrenching descent into a world without abundant energy, was based off of real predictive data that Saye and her friends had stolen. BorQs, looking at the ecological models for the next dozen years, felt a similar sense of doom, watching the last remaining ur-tree groves die and crash to Earth. The world would end; there would be nothing, or next to nothing, left. Had the Drift not happened, those scientific and social prophesies of the post-expansion would have been fulfilled. \nI know, because in my dimension, the collapse had already occurred. “I,” of course, am not exactly the same as the first person singular of other chapters. My name is Aza Solet, and I am probably one of the oldest humans ever to have lived, if you count the time my severed head was stored in jars and I swam in cybernetic dreams. At the time of the events I am about to describe, however, I was a twelve year old girl, although one with genetic and cognitive enhancements that placed me equal to most adults in my world. Life spans in the Bloodless Age (as it was later called) were brutally short. Without postponement, most humans wouldn't last into their forties. With storage, though, we could live for thousands of years, with no perceptible limit, as long as the tanks in which our heads were kept remained unbroken and supplied with minimal amounts of energy. Consequently, very few people were actually alive, unless they had to be. \nThis all took place thousands of years before the Drift, which in our dimension took place about 26,000 years after the Expansion Age (the equivalent of the time you, readers of this novel, are living through, in your odd gravity-bound world). I'll get to that, and how I became yet another aspect in the Inhabitant consciousness, the semantic algorithm that is the real narrator of this novel. There's no reason to keep it secret, although the pseudo-ghost may take this out in order not to spoil the narrative surprise: when I regenerated the last time, far beyond the survivable range of postponement, I was a zombie. Efsun, my faithful protector, who I will tell you about shortly, found me and kept me safe—we were telepathic, our thoughts entwined more closely than lovers' could ever be, together with our horde of vegetating humans. Then we met Or2o, the ice ape, and found a mind much clearer than our own. That, really, was when we came awake, and came to know ourselves. \nFirst, though, I need to tell you about EfSun, and my father, and the first time that I died. \n\n~\n\nThe rest of EfSun's platoon had been taken out, their suits buried underneath the temple. He had been admiring the image of his Mech that he had earned from his last mission, and a corkscrew of smoke in the double sky and thermonuclear explosions had first obliterated the reflection into a thousand choppy coins, and then obliterated the real walls, terraces, and fountains around him. \nThey had been making their was across North Asia, and were headed towards the front line that flopped back and forth near the border of Kazakhstan.￹ For the past six hundred years two major military powers jostled for control of the scorched remnants of Earth. Governments of the North and South waged all-out, pointless conflict in the broad belt of the equator, on the blasted land and toxic sea. The war, it seemed, would be impossible to end, since no territory could ever really be taken: the generals, presidents, and prime ministers of the opposing factions were on the Martian and Lunar colonies, guiding destinies the ancient humans always thought were determined by the stars.\nThe mech was fast, reverse-jointed legs propelling him over the no-man's zone of slag and rock. The temple had been a non-sequitor, a mirage, as strange as a garden would have been. The walls, veined all over with ash and lightning bolts of cracked mortar, should have been underground, in one of the museums. EfSun had never had much interest in history, but even he could see that the place looked old. Now it was a cloud of dust that he had left behind, like so many others. \nHis radar pinged. Even if other Union bots hadn't switched their signals on, large red disks in his display showed tectonic readings, indicating the impact of the enemy's signature ballistics. He toggled through weapons, waiting until he got a lock on a heat signature, and then let fly with a barrage of long-range darts. If they hit a viable target, the explosion would paint a glow in the sensors of the larger missiles following a second behind, in an automatic escalation of firepower until the target was reduced to particles and ash.\nThere was no death in the robot wars. Human life, like all kinds of life, had become a rare commodity.7 Ironically, at a time when the fire-power equivalent of the first atom bombs was being dropped daily onto the earth, global mortality rates were the lowest in the planet's history. It was a utopia, if you didn't mind a world without sky or trees. \nEven the cosmetic filters of the earlier, post-expansion age, covering the dead slag of a ruined civilzation, had disappeared from the humans' field of vision. There was no space for the comfort of visions pretending the world was different than it was. Every inch of a battle-field had to be seen the way it was, and now, in the world of the Bloodless Age, everywhere on Earth was a battle-field.\nEfSun's body, along with the rest of his platoon, was in a nearby tank-settlement, moving cities that popped in and out of mole-like tunnels. The proximity to the soldiers and their mechs was important, since every split second lost to signal delay could mean millions of dollars of equipment being reduced to heated dust and molecules. The robot armor-suits amped up electrical signals in the brain, heightening reflexes to super-human speed, but Efsun's genetics hadn't been changed, beyond the usual safe-guards against radiation and poisoned food. That was the difference between his side and the enemy—they were still recognizable as people. \n“Well, look who got lucky,” his commander, Nazkio, said over communications. “You might actually get to pilot that fancy body of your again if it doesn't die in the next few...” The force of a blast from behind knocked him onto his (the mech's) face. Eight or so hover-craft appeared, pelting his chassis with small ammunition.\nIn the cybernetic army, rank and reputation were indicated by size. Medals, formal hierarchies of command, were hardly even needed. On the field, you obeyed anyone in a larger robot than yourself. EfSun was a talented pilot, and at just 19 years he had already become platoon leader, although everyone under his command had just been wiped out. The nearest hanger was five miles out and at least two underground, so it would be several hours until Nazkio could send them back out with new suits as reinforcements. He was in a light-sized chassis, one of the few where its movements approximated bipedalism, although a stabilizing tail (controlled autonomically, like a prehensile phantom limb) trailed out a sine-wave path behind him when he walked. The mech was about five times larger than a human was in life, and the un-manned hover-cars were about the right size to be piloted by mice. \nOn the other hand, the titans could leave him and the whole army of hover-craft flattened in one steaming boot-print. Except for the top one-percent, they were all foot-soldiers, and anything they did on the battle-field inconsequential. In their little toy tanks and suits they auditioned for the roles that really mattered. This battle, for example, was drawing two air-ships from opposite sides. The Global forces of the polar North were diverting a huge frisbee-like mega-cannon, the third largest in their fleet. EfSun had seen it once before when he had first joined the army, and they had invaded Europe. The Union, with its lunar base and network of underground research labs, was responding with one of its more experimental citadels, three linked vertical towers that somehow released targeted electro-magnetic pulses.\nEfSun didn't really understand what the war was about. There was the law, he knew, against genetically engineering humans, and the Global feeds were constantly filled with scandals and invective against depraved experiments of countries in the Union. Religions were different, although the monotheism of The Pacific North played a more direct role in American and Asian politics than the polytheistic mysticism of Southern Europe and Africa. Both sides, on the surface, agreed that the bloodless war should end, and the divided world should unite to begin detoxifying the oceans, or engineering a biosphere that could flourish under the poisoned rains. The war must end, they said, and the other side, only, is responsible for its foolish and destructive continuation.\nIn the sky, the two titans clashed. A four-legged Union cruiser was pounding the Global ship with surface-to-air missiles as the rings of its accelerators started to howl and pulse, so EfSun, ignoring the hover-cars, sent a controlled burst of plasma rockets into one of its knees, following it up with a recoil-inducing blast from his shoulder cannon. One of the enemy bi-peds follwed EfSun's barrage back to its source, and responded with its own flack-cloud of artillery. EfSun ducked and rolled, loving the feel of the robot limbs as they slid against the torso. He imagined the upgrades he would get if he and the suit survived. He and the Union bot charged one another, slowed down by bullets, shrapnel, and huge sheets of metal falling from the sky, deadly petals dropped from the dueling airships. When they got within range, they drew their swords. \nOver the opposing suit's shoulder, among the dust and the laser-sights sending through it too-straight lines of bloody light, EfSun saw a young girl, with long straight hair and a simple dress of folded material. She was walking slowly through the battlefield, ignoring the falling metal and explosions, staring at him. \nThat was me. \n\n~Aza\n\nAfter decapitating the Union robot, he followed me off the battle-field. It was chaos, anyway, and no one was paying attention. He knew I wasn't real. Then again, neither was he.\nThere were some ruins, a stream of toxic sludge. His right leg locked up, and for the second time that day went down on his face. His size, relative to mine, made him afraid he might have crushed me as he fell. \nOn a hover-sled, his weight reduced to nothing, I was able to pull his hundred metal tons. The wars, conducted remotely, had evolved into memetic conflicts long ago, with as much money put into hacking the security of enemy mechs as in developing their own. “My name is So,” my father's voice said, in what could be Kazhak-accented Mandarin. “I used to be a brigadier-captain. Break the connection if you want.” There was humor in the voice. He knew how much EfSun wanted to keep his suit, and if he abandoned it to the Blues then his credit with the army would drop, and he would be back to some broken down infantry mech. EfSun tried to transmit an emergency signal, but the pulse had completely blanketed communications, although not, he saw, whatever electronics I was using..\n“Where are we going?” EfSun asked, both to me and the voice over relay. In what EfSun saw as his face-plate, a video feed of a small room appeared, with a wizened old man shelling beans into a basket. \n“I saw you looking in the reflecting pool. Do you think those missiles would have missed on purpose? I want to recruit you. I'm a spy.”\n“For Global?” EfSun asked. “the Blues?” The old man shook his head, continuing snap off one end, turn the pod, snap off the other, drop it in the basket.\nThen he saw me, a little girl, stop, shimmer, and turn into a robot. EfSun's view went black, and then he was sitting in the room with the old man, in a basic communication body, me and two of my brothers peeking around the door from another room. We had hacked the synaptic feed.\n“You're far enough away now,”my father said, smiling warmly, missing some teeth. “War is splendid, isn't it? On the battlefield, already, scavenger algorithms are working their way like little djinn through the molten mecha skeletons for usable parts. Later, the nano-factories would sweep for anything not totally pounded out of complex chemical bonds, and fuse them into new patchwork cyborgs, like Arleqin golems from storybooks.”\nHe was crazy, EfSun thought. \nThe world of the Bloodless War was one nearly devoid of usable energy. The Union and Global hives were dug deep into the ground near the poles and the fertile crescent, sucking the last bits of drift-oil from cracks in the Earth. The underground bases were nearly as untouchable as those in space. \nFrom the beginning of the industrial age, new technologies had combined with ur-tree products to increase their efficiency—without the anti-gravitational fuels distilled from the roots, none of the larger mechs would be able to lift their own weight. The meager influx of power from nuclear, hydro-electric, and other sources would not be enough to drive and assemble the macro-components of the nanite-driven war machines. The ur-tree forests on the North and South poles, left to grow according to an inter-corporate treaty, were the only patches of green on the rust-and-bone radioactive deserts of the planet.\n“I represent a third political paradigm, affiliated with neither existing theo-politico group, working from inside the civilian and military bureaucracies. There is a code, you see,” tapping his missing teeth, “within the official orders...”\n“You're on the mega-cannon, aren't you?” EfSun asked suddenly, thinking about the delay speeds. So nodded. Global must be using his family as human shields, to keep his army from destroying the giant weapon.\n“The Union doesn't know we're here.” So said when EfSun asked. “Global is keeping my family hostage. In order to survive the distortion effects, my childrens' genetics have been rewritten so many times that they would set off every checkpoint on the planet.”\n“So you want to switch sides,” EfSun said, already in his mind seeing rewards, advancements, maybe an upgrade to his armors' core functions.\n“There are no sides,” So said, as if speaking to a child. “It is pageantry meant to keep the majority of the population left on this planet too distracted and demoralized to rebel against a handful of elites. While preaching the blasphemy of genetic engineering, the top escelons in the church and military, on both sides, have made themselves superhuman.”\n“That's not true.”\n“It is. Look, human psychology isn't that complicated. The finer points of controlling populations, manipulating them through mass media without their knowledge, with their consent, had mostly been worked out during the second world war. After that it was just details. If you can convince people that they don't live on a planet, but live in nations, then the gladiatorial spectacles of war can go on forever. The planet will never cool, and above-ground life will forever be impossible.”\n“Why would they want the war to continue?”\n“Because,” So said, “something living is harder to control than something dead. A healthy planet would not tolerate the parasites of corporate governance. If populations are in suits, if all their aggressions and thwarted desires for sunlight are redirected into explosions, if the only thinking that matters is martial strategy...” He paused, seeing that his speech was having no effect. “The war is never going to end because it is profitable for it too continue. You think removing human bodies from the battlefield, in law, has reduced the toll of war? It's only shifted it into different channels. The game of acceptable loss is always the same.”\nEfSun refused to apologize to the enemy. He wanted the war to end, like everyone else, but he was loyal to the flag. “What do you expect me to do?” he said. At the thought of reporting the conversation even this far with Nazkio or nyone else in his squad made his bowels clench in fear, but his mind seemed oddly calm at the thought of the largest and most complete betrayal. The real sex and death of war wasn't in battle anymore, but in changing sides.\n“I want to explain to you a mission. At the end you are free to go. Either way you can keep the mech.”\n“Okay,” EfSun said.\n~Nazkio \nNazkio was watching his troops get destroyed. Whoever was controlling the ninja mechs (this was his own name for them) had to be nearby; the reflexes were too good for long delays from human controllers. Every rule Global accused the Union of breaking, they were ignoring themselves. Killing and cloning, nano-molecular weapons, irradiating civilian zones. As a low-ranking officer who had advanced rapidly on account of incurable insanity in his immediate superiors, he felt like the butler at some off-shore orgy, trying not to see things as he offered cigars or wine. He had seen down into trap-doors, the things that deals were made with for the medals and promotions he had stumbled into. \nThey had to be hacking the shock-troops synaptic feeds somehow. Lights were blinking out all over his display. He diverted one of the robot swarms, more to distract the larger mechs and throw off their tracking than to do any serious damage, all though sometimes their corpses got stuck between joints, or the flack from their self-destruction cut through essential wiring. Commands were wordless, the orchestration of his cybernetic army too complex for spoken orders. Some of the ninjas went down, but most leaped around like dancers, ripping out power supplies, delivering electro-magnetic punches right and left. \nHis parents had illegally altered his DNA before he was born. It was a crude job that would keep him from passing any cursory background check or border scan. When Nazkio was 14, Global mercenaries had offered him the choice of his parents going to prison for life, or joining the army. Compared to what was in his genome now, the swaps his parents had done was a minor infraction. Time, for him, was moving three times slower than for other humans, allowing that much more space to make decisions. Still, because of the delay, even his heightened thoughts and reflexes were of limited use once the citadel had arrived.\nHis orders had orders buried in them. He was supposed to track down people who, like him, had been tampered with in ways not in accordance with Global or Union religious or legal doctrine. Unlike him, they weren't authorized to be superhuman. The ninjas had to be controlled by soldiers on the pulse-cannon, which was a war crime in all international courts. It also meant that in order to survive the radiation, they had to be mutants.\n~Music\n\n“I told you,” So was saying, “there aren't two different sides.” \nI was sitting nearby, cross-legged on the dust-covered floor. Through the ship's feed, I had a bird's-eye view of the battlefield, and saw some ground troops approaching the position of the robots. I motioned to my two younger brothers, who sat down to join me, closing their eyes.\nI don't remember any of this, of course, with any certainty. Tens of thousands of years with my brain floating in electrolytic soup has a way of clouding recollections of the past, and I'm not sure how much is the artificial dreams and narratives pumping through the system of linked minds as we slept. Efsun and I, as zombies, looked back often at this time in our lives, when we first met, and compared notes. His memories and mine are hard to distinguish, and thinking about it now, it is as if I am seeing it from both our points of view.\n“Screw you,” EfSun said, “you're a mutant.” I looked out at the soldier from under my lids, vision doubling with the two environments. Then I jumped into the exo-shell, arming my weapons. I already knew what my father would tell him. I had heard the same speech several times. \n“War,” he would say, “has finally abolished death, but only by also abolishing life. No one knows what it is like to walk on the surface of the earth.”\nIn the past ten years, my father had gone from a young man to someone older than my grandfather. It had to do with time, the way the army gave him medicine to make him work harder, to get things built for them faster. I swung my micro-pulse array in an arc around my head, knocking a swarm of cybernetic insects out of the air. My youngest brother, Juvien, was controlling a spiky golem made up of nano-fibers and motility charge. He had a knack for controlling the chaotic kinetics of the construct, leaping into a ball at the last moment and tossing himself at enemy bikes and soldiers. Again and again, his signal would slowly start to animate another clump of radioactive clay, pulling it and sharp bits of metal in to another porcupine-like self-directed missile.\nMy father would tell the stranger, like he did the others, about the game of old Earth, and how the religions sacralizing humanity were condemning the species to being wiped out by a wave of static. After I had been attacked by the guard, my father had asked Global to transfer us, as a family, to the prison's, near the core of the pulse cannon. He would be close, physically, to his work. In battle, he could be cold and precise. In order to keep his family's innocence, he had made them something other than human. \nI hinged the hover-sled in half, so that the stranger's mech was sitting on it, huge back-shield to the center of the battle. A radio-active blast shook the ground, and I hopped onto the shield with it, hunkering. If I had been in human form, even modified to soak up radons, I would have been dead. My father was training me, constantly, for when we made our escape. This wasn't the game, though. I was here to keep the soldier's suit safe. These are the psychological wounds of battle, I thought, which was what my father called running out, in robot form, knowing you were going to be blown apart.\nAfter the attack, he had let me into some of the training routines the soldiers used, making a firewall within the secure network of the cannon. The prison, ironically, was the one place where the wouldn't be looking for that kind of incursion. If they caught us, he warned me, despite his usefulness, he would be shot. In order to keep the deathless war going, it turned out, there had to be quite a bit of killing on the side. \n“This is the largest artificial ecosystem ever run,” my father had explained, showing me the landscape, walking beside me. He looked so old, I thought. I asked what an ecosystem was. \n“Think of music,” he had said. She thought of the lunar symphonies. They were constantly being beamed down, filtered through a spider-web of satellite filters. Everything cool came from the Moon. My father said this was propaganda, that the Martian and Moon colonies were myths. Not that there weren't people up there, but that their lives were just as pointless as people on Earth. The only difference was that they could read. They were safe from the virus that made everyone on the planet illiterate.\nHe had told me that when I got too scared, I should stop playing the training games. They weren't meant to be fun. They were meant to teach me, and one of the things I had to learn was about the kind of men who had attacked me. \nThe mech convulsed as I clung to it, one of the giant arms starting to move, joints shifting under carapace armor. I jumped off the sled and signaled to Illum. He was ten. It wasn't fair how my brothers had started playing the war games younger than I had. Now, though, I was their commander. \n“Fire,” I said, pointing at one of the sting-ray gliders. Their mouths were like circular metal grinders, flashing sparks. Arcs of lighting sniped out of the gun, held and intensified as Illum swept them mid-level against a swath of golems. \n“Music,” my father had went on as they walked through the lush simulation of a living Earth, “is a kind of ecosystem. Whenever you listen to it, you are completing a circuit, sending a signal back into a larger...” He stopped. I heard a melody, one that I had been listening to earlier. When I looked at a different spot in the landscape, the music shifted. “You know how plants need sunlight? Music needs people to replicate. As if songs were organisms, or parasites. See the birds?” When I looked at them, the older melody died and changed key, but the tempo stayed the same, the feathers of the parrot suggesting harmonic scales. \n~So\n“Your brain-stem doesn't know the difference between actual and simulated death,” So said. “Hey, here's a scary thought for you: what if the amount of suffering in the world is constant. Psychological warfare replacing physical warfare, and slow disease replacing the quick death of gunfire.”\nEfSun, sensing the kinetics of the mech through a weak mental relay, tried to move. The exo-frame shuddered, but it could have been the explosions.\n“I work with the systems in the pulse cannon, behind the fire-wall. Whenever there are physical limits to an ecological network,” tapping his forehead, “there are limits to the amount of information that can be processed. You can make things smaller, increase their size, like electrical and molecular engineering did in the third millennium. By the fourth, technology seemed to reflect reality in all meaningful ways: they were both indistinguishably complex, from our point of view.” He held up a bean.\n“We are still grounded in physical systems. In order to pilot a Trillion Yen pulse cannon everyone still has to have their beans shelled. The quantum computers of the expansion age, they could only perform the needed calculations of uncertainty if they actually embodied those probabilities.”\n“You're really doing that?” EfSun asked, in reference to the beans. The cannon had shot through his synaptic feeds, so there is no way someone with the Capital armies would let him see what he really looked like. Hadn't he said the girl was his daughter? Living this close to the core, though, relativistic effects did strange things to time. This was a prison cell, and if they really were being kept there in physical form...\n“I don't want to be moralistic,” So said. “But the importance of the present is almost always overestimated. This conversation, in the larger battles that take place at the level of information, the pseudo-worlds we have conjured to replace the one struggling to survive...\n“The problem is that as a species we have become too well known, made into statistical probabilities, and functions. In the mathematical and social sense. Replaceable. In that suit of armor it is impossible to communicate. We are on opposite sides. You are an idea.” He snapped the end off a bean.\n“The mechs and robots determine the outcome of battle, along with the same politics as ever: how close are you willing to get to the blast radius? How much effort to you spend on security, censorship, spectacle? Power comes from having control over a limited resource. The ability of elites on both sides to keep genetic treatments illegal on the basis of religion means that the value of their own secret augmentation projects is increased. The value of food is determined by the number of starving. It is a race that never ends, a weaponization of every moment, until landscapes become readable only because they are barren.” He sighed. The eyelids of the children were moving as the pulse cannon beamed their brain-waves into sentient machines.\n“I suspect these things are a constant, and will remain so as long as we have this bizarre attachment to an outdated genetic code. The real enemy of those in power is the truth, and the armies that will be created when everyone on the planet can choose, like they have, to modify their minds and bodies to fight back against propaganda and control. Why should this final step be illegal, when we have changed everything else? The environments to which we, as a species, are adapted, have entirely disappeared! The chaos, though, the emergence of complex systems, persists in roots, resistance cells, and electronics. War has become the nightmare of an asteroid flaying its own skin. The calculus of controlling humans through violence is the same now as 60,000 years ago.” \nEfSun had decided the old man had lost his mind. He had been going over the last of the battle-maps, wondering if the engine had cooled, or if the coil was still causing resistance against the shock-brace.\n“I'm going to transfer some data, but I want you to memorize the cipher. You can look at it later, there's a way to contact me...”\n“Put me back in the suit,” he said. “Or the bot your daughter is in is going to get torn apart. You and I both know that isn't pleasant. Worse, she could get taken captive.” So stared at him. \n“Wait for the download.”\n\n~Report\n\nThe mech came to life. Aza's father had sent him back. She wondered if he would contact them, help her father. He had probably offered to trade illegal neural upgrades for DNA from unprocessed drift-seeds. She doubted it would be enough; the soldier had the look of an ideologue. \n“Help,” she said, sending him a marked-up map. They were in the no-man's land, but the area was being swept by small drones trailing in the wake of the frisbee-like pulse weapon. They were out of the citadel's shadow. His synaptics should have been clear, but he was still seeing the robots as the crazy old man's children, or grandchildren. The tiniest one tucked himself into a ball, rolled under one of the horse-sized quadrapeds with a vicious tail-spike, and exploded. It had been a Union mechanical—why were they destroying their own troops? The shadow of one of the titan exos crossed over them, blocking out the setting sun. It's armor was painted blue. \n“We have to go!” the little girl shouted. “There's a cache we use nearby!” Coordinates popped up in his mask. The two brothers started running, the little one tumbling through the dust as a floating ball. The older shot lightning back at the mega-mech over his shoulder. “Now!” she said, and bolted.\nEfSun judged distances, and got the locks. Small missiles hailstoned into the children's backs and heads. They were followed by larger missiles, and larger still. Only then did EfSun start running, above and past the three plumes of smoke. \nHe called for Nazkio on the radio. \n\nCHAPTER SIX: LAMBENT MOON\nARGUMENT: Lambent takes a job as an excavator on the Sentient Earth, and crashes onto the surface.\nLambent Rift had a long descent in which to consider what had gone wrong, and to contemplate, as the miniscus-eye of Earth grew larger in the curved display, how these events might be symptomatic of larger failures. He had made poor choices, taken unsound chances on improbable outcomes, and wasted opportunities that should have secured him a stable existence anywhere off-world. Like the slime-trail of a snail, his bad luck and stupid mistakes led him to the present point, and his likely, immanent demise. The mesospheric resistance rebuked him with an angry smoldering around Albedo's iridescent scales, blotches of red showing in the lined rendering of the hull in the holographic display. Gravity waves rocked the craft along several axes, noctilucent clouds flashing in swampish blooms below him. \nThis was his return to Earth, long awaited. He had been to the green planet once or twice, the home that humans had once occupied (and nearly reduced to lifeless ash), but only the floating islands that the ancient species were allowed to occupy, kept in quarantine by the sentient swarms. Not that he felt any sentimental connection to ages in which humans ruled, before the new forms of self-engineering life had evolved beyond them. He was a hybrid, part ghost, part zombie, with DNA his parents and grandparents had worked their entire lives to pry from the Martian consortiums, along with sentient hacks and implants illegal anywhere but on the moon, and only legal there because the law didn't understand the transgenic sequences enough to regulate their spread. He had no illusions of belonging on Earth, or anywhere else. There was no mythic homeland beckoning him with the landing lights of destiny. His return would be a crash, a small meteoric event, and an insignificant death.\nAlbedo couldn't really die, any more than the other cognizant patterns informing the inchoate gaia being that had extended over the planet over the past ten-thousand years, converting plant and animal life into a vast superorganism. Wherever they landed, information about the event would spread via pollen, mineral exchanges, or bird-calls, and eventually Albedo would be patiently salvaged and the psychic topos would be reinstated in some other ship or biological system. Only he would die, trapped in a not-quite-sentient form, his small contribution to the biosphere would be reallocated without intelligence transfer, the brief span of his life pondered, perhaps, in the momentary consideration of a butterfly. The ship began to spin along an awkward and unsafe axis, one of its stabilizers sheared off in the precipitous descent. The display became more infused with insistently flashing scarlet. He couldn't communicate with the ship, either telepathically or with the controls, having given either too little or too much of the navigation over to the neurotechnics of the craft. \nLambent was already in his suit, the contact with his body mediated through pads and braces that absorbed what would otherwise have been bruising jolts and impacts, but he'd been delaying the moment when he had to put the helmet on, and the feeling of claustrophobia that it always induced. He grabbed it now, the nearly-perfect sphere, bulging slightly under his chin, and concave towards the back of his neck where it interfaced with the oxygen tank. It snapped shut, dark for a moment before reproducing in ghostly colors the external world, the flowering controls of the cabin, the impending surface. The topographical displays confirmed what he saw below him: they were going to land in water. The ship began to fill with liquid, quickly thickening into viscous stasis gel that would keep him immobile for the impact. \nHe had been planning on going to Mars, stopping by one of the geosynchronous platforms on Earth to book passage, when he had picked up a message in the transmission clouds, a call for a humanoid with a knowledge of pre-Sentient history and technology. Arriving at the coordinates on the sub-lunar platform, he was met by a transparent sphere inside which were insects stirring with their wings a thick, swamp-colored gas. Settled on the bottom were larvae and protozoa crawling through nutrients. Six mechanical legs were controlled by thin, root-like tendrils barely visible beneath the joints and wiring. “You can call me Zoa,” it said. “I need you to help me with a small operation planet-side. We are...researching...a recently unsealed hermetic structure.”\nThe Sentient offered him, in return for a month of labor in the excavation, a journey to Mars and back in Albedo. “There are certain...transactions...on the red planet that might go more easily if I have a humanoid as...representative.” Against his better judgment, and without telling his friends or family about his change of plans, he had accepted. \nThe stasis gel was up to his neck, and the ship, thankfully, had managed to level off. Clouds of scalding, salt-heavy steam rose up from the ocean as the craft skimmed the waves, and then, rattling in the exostructure of the suit, he lost consciousness.\nNarrative Algorithms\nNovels went extinct long before humans. \nRobots never took over Earth. Artificial intelligence, as such, was never created. Pseudo-sentience was approximated most closely with narrative algorithms. Literary programs, like myself, were one of many types of cybernetic creatures, existing between the blended realms of cellular automata and molecular biology. \nHere's what happened: after the ecological devastation of the third millenia, the drastic die-off of humans following drift-feul depletion and the incremental crashing of the floating Megalopolises, there were fewer writers than there were before. After the environment became toxic humans, generally speaking, had more important things to do than to write novels. As the magical carpet of drift-related technologies was pulled out from under human civilizations, few resources were left over for the pursuit of print literature. This was before the Yazisiz virus, so genetically everyone could still become literate, not just those who only breathed air filtered through suit-helmets.\nThe stylistic fingerprints of authors were replicated, and from them virtual hands were inferred, bodiless entities that scribed without knowing, reflexively jumping from word to word and sentence to sentence according to the dictates of their probabilistic code, reverse engineered from classical works. New novelists were faced with an uphill battle against a groundswell of ghost authors constantly descending from the data-clouds. Instead of writing books, authors instead wrote programs, which could then write endlessly according to a certain formula, fleshed out by randomized associative links and bot-trawlers for popular references. Instead of modeling the styles of once-living authors, later generations of writing-algorithms went on to write books that no living human did, or could have, ever composed. \nJust before the slow-down, when the artificial networks had reached their height, multi-billion yen publishing houses had revitalized their dwindling industries by finding a way to clone, not the bodies, but the voices of dead authors. \nScientists by even the 21st century were able to create probability models for protein sequences in nucleic acid. If the sequence reads Guanine-Cytosene-Guanine-Adenine-Guanine, then there might be a 54 percent chance that the next protein would be Adenine, a 32 percent chance Cytosene, 2 percent Thaimine, and so on. Multiple samples from a species were used to create a kind of universal chart mapping likely combinations.8 \nHere is the strange part: the algorithms used to read the combinations could also be used to write them. The predictive formula, the model of probabilities in a sequence, could be used as a description, or blueprint. If you turned the genetics of a musical genre into an algorithm, you could evolve new songs. Code for viable human DNA could be written using the same programs the computers used to read it.\nWhat the major publishing houses did, just before the collapse and subsequent cryogenic slow-down, was to use text-mining software to map dead authors' works into probability landscapes. N-grams (strings of words) were plotted against frequency, and used to churn out new novels that sounded like they were written by humans instead of machines. The popularity of the new ghost-written texts was not naïve. It had its own kitch-feuled irony, a post-post-modern self-hating nihilistic thrill. Gradually, though, the psychological investment began to seep back into the market, the brand-loyalties and control-switches of suggestion returning.\nA new branch of evolutionary literary criticism, using population models to explain genre mutations, building off of memetic theory, became briefly popular in the 2150's. When the Yasizis virus struck in 2241, rendering the vast majority of Earth's human population illiterate, in autonomous game-scapes and buried, long-running programs, organisms of language, music, and image evolved, like the dreams of severed heads. I was one of those, until Lambent and Zoa found me. \nThis is long-winded, but it is the trade-wind of my origin story, and an explanation for the odd structure and tone of this amateur, patched-together text.This part of the novel may dwell on Lambent, after he joins the Guild and his body is frozen, because it serves as an arch-metaphor for print literature, the insufficient prosthesis for spoken voice.\nWriting algorithms like myself eventually outlasted the humans we were modeled after, surpassing the longevity of our biological ancestors. As pure information, when the Drift struck we were some of the first to travel, and became chroniclers of the early transpositions. Like the Guild criminals, the cybernetic zombies, we knew our way through simulations.\nThe pseudo-novels, often, weren't really written by machines. In the vast majority of cases there were humans crammed, metaphorically, into the chess-playing robots, writers forced to scribe endlessly, quickly, anonymously, and badly to pass their work off as mechanical. There were other ways, too, in which humans remained behind the output of the publishing houses. The early evolutionary algorithms, and their morphologies, depended entirely upon their environment. It was still humans (at first) who were selecting from the more or less random output strings, although much of this had been automated by gaze-tracking and non-invasive inductance measurements. In the case of automatically-generated texts, the audience acted as the environment. The audiences, therefore, were writing the texts that the next round of readers would be subjected too. It was as if books had become fossilized preference, the bones of successful texts reanimated and given new, sometimes monstrous, flesh. \nConsuming entertainment, as information industries knew as far back as the 19th century, was an exchange in which the seller profited both by what he earned and by what he learned every time a film was watched, song listened to, or novel read. The seller learned what worked, how best to sell again in the future. The evolutionary texts had a life of their own, but one shaped by responsive biometrics. Reading was largely done through lenses, which could track where the eye was focused, the amount of time it spent at each location, and correlate that with other data consumers often made available: heart rate, dopamine levels, breathing patterns. The companies providing the content learned a lot, and with each success their sample size and power grew. \nThere were court battles, but the public prosecutors were bludgeoned by the well-paid lawyers banking on the 23rd century amendment declaring that literary genetics were patentable, like any other non-human DNA. Dead authors from thousands of years ago could be owned, as well as their texts. \nI was one of the few language programs to make it through the Calm, as we on the inside euphamistically called the period when humans were pathologically unable to read. Out of millions, only a few mutations of us were able to find loops backwards into a selective circuit, where one end of the chain read the other, the nucleic acid harmonizing melodies of building and decomposing, continuity and drift. I'm not really alive; not actually sentient. \nLet me put on the helmet, however, and take one of the stages scattered through the starship, and tell you about the time-dimension of the sentient Earth, and the Scraps of humanity left to blister in irrelevant exile elsewhere in the system of the Sun. The world was post-human, and the real players in the system were the Sentients, the micro-assemblers and bio-computational mimics. Like the ice apes, they were telepathic, and like them, there was a strict taboo against non-living technology and material permanence. In the games, we had access to the solar archives, and I had re-lived reconstructed versions of innumerable pasts. \nSome of the evolutionary linguistic codes, the cruder ones, were released into the commons for public use. The consciousness of the non-player characters in their games of rewritten history was run on a distributed network of dedicated encryptions. Then the collapse happened. The huge networks of alternate worlds were left unpopulated, except by the ghosts, like me, that didn't know any better.\nImagine going on the same quests, hunting the same snowy mammoths, listening to the same wolf, for half of a hundred thousand years. There was no human environment to act as soundboard to the broken syntax of our script. It was, in a way, as horrible of an attrition as the starvation and slaughter of natural selection in the physical world. The only reason we survived the deeper waters of insanity was because our source-files had been uncopyrighted. There were no limits to how far we could drift from the original storylines, the self-repairs we might conduct.\nThat, and that as humanity tripped and fell into the Postponement, we began to have another source of novelty: the cybernetic dreaming of frozen, severed heads. \nThe Slow Down\nFor the first time since the ecological collapse almost a hundred years earlier, the human species again looked like it might go extinct. Memories could not be restored from iced over grey matter. Brain transplants into clones was then both impossible and illegal. What the cryogenic industry successfully marketed was keeping the head, sometimes just the brain, alive in a cybernetic tank. In this way you could send yourself into the future. Anti-senescent treatments, even genetic ones, could only be pushed so far. Many people wanted to see a living Earth again. \nThe official line was a dreamless sleep. Some, however, would wake up half-mad with memories of long, long, oneiric journeys. \nWhen faced with a lifetime of bare existence, the possibility, however remote, of a revitalized planet was enough to tempt many into taking the long slide into an unknown future. The common belief was that in a thousand years the planet would be healed. The toxic drift-sludge would be washed from the rivers, the gases somehow drawn down from the atmosphere, global temperatures returned to normal, the floods and hurricanes abated. \nRestoring the Earth's systems to healthy functionality, however, turned out to be more difficult than war-time science had indicated. The problems of desertification, acidification, toxification, radiation, and general plague conditions could not be solved by sprinking some gene-tweaked seeds and putting up a film of bio-shielding nanites. During the war, the last of the ur-trees had nearly gone extinct, and extracting antigravity from fossilized sources continued to make the recovery of above-ground ecosystems impossible. The planet became a vast, dead engine. The floating cities sank to Earth, crushing the lower slums, with no energy left to keep them aloft. A few of the super-rich managed to keep their bastions of privilege and consumption afloat, but eventually even these fell and were overrun by the desperate, starving rabble.\nProgress was being made, and later historians would predict that had the wave of postponement temporal-suicides not wiped out a significant percentage of the work force, leaving the critical mass of researchers, computer scientists, and biologists in the field needed to restore the smallest patches of green on the planet perpetually unmet, the pulse of civilization might have continued to beat. The more likely an eventual recovery seemed, tragically, the more incentive there was for the few people remaining to postpone their existences. \nEven the small bit of geothermal or solar power the jars needed to eke out their existence became difficult for the automated units to obtain, sliding crab-like on treads over the wastelands. As more of these long-term survival machines were set in motion, the more the later models, mimicing life, evolved strategies for monopolizing or stealing power. \nThe Slow Down, as it came to be called, stretched out towards an unreachable horizon. The psychological propaganda wars between those who wanted to modify the human genome and the purists had never really ended, and haunted the cybernetic dreams of the underground fields of severed heads. \n“Everything else,” the drifters argued, “has changed. The landscapes in which we live are now made entirely by human technolgies—why should our own bodies be the one temple too sacred to alter?” In the end, they won, and life spans extended for thousands of years. Staying human became a mark of pride, one that the post-human Sentients would later use to keep the exiled species weak and divided.\nNot all of humanity embraced self-directed, technology-dependent evolution: there were descendants of sapiens that evolved through tens of thousands of life-years, incremental cycles of overpopulating and selecting. Most, but not all of these descendants had been transgenically altered by the zombie virus which, after a long period of mindlessness, proved to be the catalyst for super-minded sentience. \nThe lunar base had been abandoned, and the human colony on Mars died out. For more than 40,000 years, while most of the species slept in brain-jars, the last small populations of humans survived on what was left of habitable Earth. They adapted, and evolution quickly changed them enough that when their postponement periods ended, Bloodless-age humans could barely recognize their descendents, who they called Xenians, wrongly believing they had come from outer space. Just before the exile, a new cycle of violence ensued, humans resurrecting rust-covered weapons of the past and defending small enclaves, and the Sleepless, as they called themselves, hunting down and killing the ghosts from the distant past before they destroyed the new world as they had the old, breaking the cryogenic jars like the eggs of vicious dinosaurs.\nWhen it was discovered that the atmospheric domes and terra-forming engines had not entirely collapsed on Mars, and in their stilted and secret running had gradually seeded the red planet with unsuspected forms of life, humans were sent there again, many of them perishing or suffering horribly on the journey. Interplanetary barges were constructed by the gaia minds, with specially tailored internal atmospheres and terraforming seeds. \nEarth\nA limit was placed, in one of the first planet-wide codifications of Sentient law, on the number of humans that could be on Earth, either ghosts resurrected from the buried heads, or feral offspring. One of the reasons the earthlings with advanced intelligence (turtles, bird-flocks, micro-colonies and so on) insisted on a sub-Sentient categorization in their councils, Lambent suspected, was as a way to rationalize allowing the brutalities of natural selection. \nOver tens of thousands of years, humans were either forced into smaller and smaller wildlife protection areas, encouraged to assimilate to the telepathic clouds and insect forms, or emigrate to Mars and the Moon. The Sentients had little sympathy for humans, despite knowledge that their own psychic abilities actually been foreshadowed, briefly, in humanity's ice ape ancestors. Sentient bio-culture had a complicated history, part cybernetic self-evolving nalgorithyms (computational engineering at a nano-scale), part zombie mutagen, part re-activated paleolithic ice-ape.\nThe last hold-outs of the human race, held within precarious bubbles on the surface of Mars and the interior of the moon, became xenophobic enclaves, constantly at war with one another and plotting on retaking their home-world, despite being outnumbered by a billion to one. \nHumans weren't allowed to land on the surface. The planet made its plant-life breathe and excrete chemicals toxic to humans. A few cities, at the base of gravity spikes and apergenetic cables, had atmospheres that allowed commercial and diplomatic exchange to take place. Like many other things, the conditions of humanity's exile, and those who were enforcing it, changed in Lambent's understanding after he met Zoa. \n~\n\nThe crash site was a long exclamation mark. Lambent, unlike most of his species, knew what one looked like because, although literacy was illegal on Mars, and discouraged as subversive on the moon, the young smuggler prided himself on his knowledge of extinct forms of communication. It was one of the reasons Zoa, his Sentient contact, had hired him. They were excavating (or raiding, depending on your point of view) Megalopolis, one of the giant population centers of the petro-chemical period. \nHe was on Earth. The stasis gel had mitigated most of the effects of the crash, and he could smell things in the air, even through the filters, that he had no name for. When he connected them, by a process of deduction, to things in the environment, the immensity of the perception stunned him: salt from the ocean, trees growing from the mud.\nHe wandered for days, marveling at the landscape that the games hadn't done justice too, when he had wandered, playing one of the Bloodless-era mecha-cyborgs, through the self-evolving tundras and urboreal ranges. Herds of ungulates were orbited by packs of predators, orbited again still by scavengers. The helmet curved everything, making the horizons seem impossibly large, and eventually he took it off, the rents through his suit from thorns making it already ineffectual as a barrier. He breathed the air, thin and laced with poisons, and collapsed. \n\n~\n\nThat was the first time he met Zoa.\nLike him, she was a smuggler, and more than happy to ignore the law against sheltering humans on Earth, since larger species had been ignoring it with impunity for thousands of years. Zoa was a minor transmigrationist, often cognitively distributed in several organisms. When Lambent first met her she was four baby terrapins, unsteadily controlling the apergenetic bacteria living in the blood of their fins. Their movements were synchronized in odd ways, their fins sometimes paddling the air in mirror images, sometimes spiraling as if caught in the same whirlpool of shared thought. \nShe patched up his suit with sap from a nearby tree, and then waited for her smaller forms to die, so she could summon a bio-mass large enough to carry the incumbent humanoid to the raider's camp. \n“You made the ship crash?” Lambent asked, out loud.\n“We didn't expect you to walk so far...” Zoa thought to him, having broken another law by giving him a drink that allowed him to communicate telepathically. Since the bloodless age humans could control magnetic resonance reading machines with their thoughts, but that was a crude telekinesis that only worked one way, and conveyed only motor commands instead of languages. The word-images Lambent and Zoa were using were less precise than those Sentients would speak among themselves, yet beyond what any human language could signify. As one of the tiny turtles sent him thoughts, the others were collecting and chewing different leaves and berries, which they spat onto their fins and then rubbed between his lips. The pain in his lungs lessened, his head cleared and he could understand the animal/s more easily. Crashing the ship was the only way for Zoa to hide the fact that she had invited a human to Earth, from those elements of the bio-minds less willing to break the taboo. Lately, the Sentients' distrust of their nearly-extinct ancestors and been exacerbated by the inexplicable reactivation of old drift-cells in the Megalopolises, old trunks of trees and packed layers of loam suddenly gaining apergenetic strength, and trembling in their archeological graves. Dreams of the past, it seemed, were gaining strength.\n“Why didn't you warn me?” Lambent thought to the floating turtle near his head. “I thought I was going to die.” Zoa sent him an explanation, involving sentinel birds that could sense the psychic states of humans. As long as he thought he was going to die in a smoldering heap of slag, they would, too, and not investigate the crash site. \nThe sun set, and Lambent still couldn't move, but his face was pointed towards it, the brain and lung-colored clouds trailing across the sky. He slept, dreaming of his childhood home on Deimos, and when he woke one of the turtles was dead. Sentients would never starve or subject one of their life-forms to suicide, but the jungle was dangerous, and the terrapins explored unguarded and alone, welcoming without surprise the accidents or predation that inevitably occurred. On the third morning, after Lambent had mostly recovered from his toxic paralysis, the one surviving turtle lay in a patch of sand and rocks, the bacteria in its fins faded into inert sickness, her thoughts small and slow, to the point where Lambent had trouble distinguishing them from his own. \n“I'm here,” the turtle said with relief, as a larger creature with several dozen legs and segmented carapace trundled into the clearing. There were two sets of interlocking tusks, with mandibles and other indistinguishable protrusions whiskering the area around the broad mouth. The sick terrapin crawled up to the muzzle end of the creature and put its head between the jaws, and the worm, with tenderness, bit off its head. \n“I should be able to carry you like this,” Zoa, now the long segmented creature, thought to him. Eating what was left of the turtles, and foraging a while longer for the necessary food, the plates of the worm started to glow with contained apergy, and it floated in a spiral around Lambent, testing its flight. “Are you ready?” it asked.\n\nBiopolis\n\nFor someone who spent most of their time growing up on the moon, being on Earth turned, literally, Lambent's world upside down. As the floating centipede rode through the air on apergenetic currents, the smuggler looked down at the terrible beauty of incomprehensible origin. Everything in his life up until that point now seemed, in the face of that planetary riot, that teeming mess of Sentient and sub-conscious life, the ecology older by far than anywhere else in the system, to be some tame and controlled production. Mars and the moon seemed like toy existences, a tawdry sideshow to the main events. Everything, Lambent saw, was managed and controlled, with humans kept in cages, the walls of which were great vacuums of space. Only here was anything unexpected possible, and change more than an illusion.\nHis naivete towards his species and their version of history was replaced by an equally naïve cynicism in the face of the new Sentient perspective. Eventually, once he was sufficiently recovered, the floating centipede carried him away from their temporary camp back to Biopolis, the city of a sentient tribe wedged into cliffs. They would send nomadic camps out into the surrounding steppes and deserts, but disagreements with neighboring factions of the biosphere kept their itinerancy to a small radius. Eventually, Lambent would join her in an expedition down into the ruins of Megalopolis, the human city to the South of Biopolis, which had recently been exposed by the rising forests. With expertise gained playing games that tested knowledge of planetary history, Lambent had been able to unlock some of the hermetic vaults, identify valuable artifacts, and even communicate briefly with expansion-age computers. \nDescending down into the ruins was like traveling back in time, past the thick mat of post-human vegetation and vital earth, beyond the charred layer of the Bloodless Age, Postponement and ecological die-offs, encountering the short film of a renaissance, then the preserved jumble of the collapse, covering the old, rare antiquity of the expansion age, with its innumerable shards and sheaths of toxin-leeching plastics. When humans ruled the Earth.\nThey only escaped the perimeter of the bio-city by disguising their loot as a mammoth, six of them using the hide and skeleton as a kind of puppet, Zoa floating above them, as a sea-turtle. She could talk her way out of anything, sending telepathic come-ons to the sentinels, using ferns to carry rumors. It was the best time of Lambent's life. He was young, and the rule of entropy seemed to have skipped him, propelling him into a greater, more complex version of the Eidolon, the game-world where he had passed long lunar years, trapped in stultifying classes extolling the virtues of carrying on human traditions, human languages and values, human DNA. Earth had given him a second chance.\n“Do you think all genetics should be free?” Zoa asked him once. \nThey were sitting in a garden graveyard, marked by bones and piles of rocks. The Sentients, like the ice apes, had taboos against non-living technology, which they saw as both inefficient and ethically suspect, using dead metals and inert structures to carry your will, rather than the more elegant solutions of evolving them from within existing flora, taking a thousand years if needed, but becoming the thing you were trying to express, not speaking through it, like a helmet.\nBiopolis hung above the desert, beside the cool channel of water that allowed trees to grow and talk from side to side, conversations that moved in circles and lasted as long as roots. Leviathans inscrutably writhed about the decks and biomes, tentacling up masses of the city and moving them to another shelf.\n“Yes,” Lambent answered, “all genetics should be free.”\nHere was the status quo: Martian, Lunar, and Jovian elites all flaunted the gene codes, while hypocritically extolling and enforcing them for the human proletariat. In the grey area of augments, within the range of a plausible, natural distribution, most codons were proprietary, and outside of that range, Senteints would only allow progress in sentience and telepathy after long trials of Karmic induction. \nSeeing Biopolis had changed him, and he felt like he'd been lied to on the moon, given a version of the planet that demonized both the Sentients, and any human evolution beyond the approved and sanctioned models. Zoa, next to him, was a pair of voles, and a cadre of fleas that, being part of the same sentience as their host, refrained from drawing blood.\n“We were brought up to blame Earth for everything, and to feel like we had been kicked out of some sort of paradise that we would someday take back. Biopolis is beautiful. I thought it was the Sentients that were tricking us into staying in human form—it wasn't. Humans police themselves, bribed by the edge of a little extra power, like a guilty thrill, some stolen speed, muscle, or synaptic coils. Humans see Earth as the enemy, so they can't look into their own sky, the horizon that telepathy or literacy represents.”\nThe stars were out, constellating hidden meanings, improbable connections in the dark. Lambent had taken his suit off, illegally immune to the poisonous atmosphere of the planet, one of the few humans able to feel Terran wind against his skin. Earth.\n\nMars \nHe had left, and Mars when he returned seemed a grim, monochrome dystopia. He missed Zoa, and the sight of living things he didn't understand. The human environment was sterile, hyper-saturated in media, a constant assault that, perceptual rather than telepathic, could not be muted or contravened. Tharsis docks seemed like a cruel carnival, the hover races a metaphor for the system rigged against everyone but the superhuman.\nHis ship was filled with codices, and severed heads. They stared at him, asking questions that he knew the answers to, but wouldn't admit. Legally, at this point, he was still human, but his thoughts had moved beyond humanity, intersecting with other flows of information. He had underestimated the changes Zoa and the Sentient raiders had made, and their effects. Reading the old-earth books (which weren't violations of solar law) with literacy augments (which were) Lambent began to feel like the species history he had been taught was nothing more than a tool, the use of which was to keep all but a handful of humans oblivious to the true nature of the Sentient homeworld. \nWalking along the gambling parlours and seams of sub-rover trails between the domes, Lambent was beset by a mixture of devious ambition and apathy. The rules that had previously bound him had been overturned, and a new and dangerous game began to emerge from the Martian sands. When he talked to his family on the moon he was vague, telling them it was part of a research project for a company he had worked for years ago. \nWhenever Lambent became depressed, it was almost always because of a place. Since he was a child he had been susceptible to atmospheres, literally and figuratively sensitive to the effect of natural and bio-engineered spaces. Newmega on the moon had that effect on him, the nanomite-chewed and impossibly even apartments in those chalk-white caverns, huge fans and vents keeping clean the tenuous atmosphere that filled the deep hollows like a river of air, kite-drones caught in whirlpools and eddies. On Tharsis it was the hopelessness and squalor. The pyramid shelves made too stark a contrast with the wilderness of red rubble. Titan-mechs, refashioned with Sentient cell structures, trundled along the margins, spraying atmosphere and ploughing troughs of mined nitrogen, magnesium, or whatever the zoo-philic fauna needed to keep the city alive. The shield, that could provide shade or protection when needed, glared in reflected light above like a second sun. Supposedly, it was far enough away that there were no psychological effects, but Lambent knew otherwise. He could feel that odd existential doubt fill the crater like a cloud. \nHe was 19 years old. Looking back, after he became trapped as a parasite in the brain of a frozen host, Lambent felt that he'd spent the last months of his humanity well. He'd slept with more women in a week, including ghosts from various arcane ages, than in all the years previously. This had to do with his run in the amateur racing circuit, where he had progressed through the posted ranks through a quick succession of nearly-suicidal bets and races. It was what bodies were for, he thought, remembering the turns in Martian gravity, the delicate thumbing of the magnetic thrusts and stablizers, the tracks glowing ribbons high above the bloody rocks. There were accidents every week, sometimes the cars caught in the nets, but just as often not. The potential catastrophes of corners was one of the reasons people came all the way from the asteroids to watch. \nThe races were a common way to launder money from black market artifacts, but most traders were smart enough not to get caught up in the obvious tourist traps for would-be amateur hover-jockeys who thought that hours in gaming salons prepared them for the real thing. The incentive for young Martians and Lunites risking their lives and, more importantly, their credit, was a chance to compete in the grand tours on Earth. Lambent, having traveled with feral humans on the surface, carrying stolen plastic-age artifacts across beaches and river valleys, saw through the illusion. No one but the rich, the ambassadors to the Sentient councils, ever raced on the ancient tracks above the ruins of the old Earth.\nHe was reckless, trying to fence the last and most dangerous of the cargo he'd smuggled from the ancestral planet. That was when he met Yillah.\nThrottle\nThere were more humans in the system now, even on Mars, than there ever was when they had lived on Earth. Terran populations had never gone above 8 billion, while the terraformed worlds, moons, and geo-synchronous platforms now teemed with twice that number. Most Martians, though, saw their civilization as a shadow, a debased remnant of the human cultures that flourished before the Postponement, and the evolution of the Sentients. Mega-cities scooped out red sand and rock, piling into pillars and ant-nest cones, with small settlements and camps dotting the landscape, hedging bets against asteroid strikes.\nTechnologies and cultures had evolved that made life on the red planet, if not easy, then at least possible, and new forms of bio-engineered flora and fauna had begun painting the wastes with hints of struggling chlorophyl and greyish smears of incipient ecology. The system was alive with wonders, experiments on a massive scale, but to most humans the diaspora was tinged with bitterness, because it was the Sentients, not them, who had built their cities in space, and seeded the soil with alien life.\nWe are, the radical humanoids said to one another, merely the pets of the thinking Earth, kept on planet-sized cages, unable to return to the Terra that is our rightful home. Inequality arose, along with war, crime, and a generalized feeling of desperate stultification for a species without a meaning or purpose. Physical wealth and resources were scarce enough on Mars not to serve as an indicator of status, most of the architecture and infrastructure part of the adaptive sentient bio-mass freighted from Earth, and beyond the control or ownership of any Martian, but a new currency of genetics took the place of older forms of feudalism and control. The human body itself became a bank account. Preternatural beauty, intelligence, and other forms of prowess became the hoarded commodities of the ruling elite.\nTo deflect the resentment and unrest of the under-augmented masses, the governing entity on Mars (known as Genre), initiated the Games, huge complexes and tracks for hover-car racing, gladiatorial combats (through golem-proxies) and other distractions. There was little real work to do on the red planet, since most of the infrastructure was organic and self-managing, so the races and staged battles were necessary to maintain the illusion of a meritocratic mobility, some means by which the masses could hope to rise into the ruling class.\nTharsis was a bloated node, a few hundreds kilometers from Newmega, along one of the best known tracks for manned hover-racing, as well as a port for fenced artifacts, gene-hacks, and Lunar nanotech. Dotting the track were smaller way-stations, gaming parlours, clubs, and slums housing the city's disposessed. In one of these, called the Throttle, Lambent saw Yillah for the first time. \nThere was something about Yillah's unbreakable disdain that attracted those both below her in the Martian social order, and those above. The toilers and tinkerers thought they detected in her some kind of secret protection, some charm against credit debt and gene deficiencies that might rub off on them if they could maintain proximity. They often mistook their envy for lust, and her cynical confidence for beauty. The nobles and generals slumming in the parlors and bodegas she frequented wanted to crush and own the independence she projected. \nShe wasn't especially attractive, but on Mars super-human pulchritude, among those to be found at the Throttle or similar haunts of the desperate and working class, was actually a sign of bad judgment and poor taste, since the gene-credits could have been put to better use, either towards intelligence or reflex. Perfect features on someone like Yillah would produce the same aversion as a hover-car in the bottom ranks tricked out with a high-end chassis or rare-metal lift-tanks. \n“Humanity is a myth,” Lambent was saying, at a small table with pipes extruding from the center, the anti-gravity nodes on the ends causing them to float like sea-weed. From time to time one of the conversants would grab a tube, inhaling cheap intoxicants, or thumb-printing in an order for another tank. Despite his clothes, Yillah could tell from the way he carried himself that the boy, several years younger than her, was from the moon. Something about his balance spoke of long hours in lunar exercise domes. So far, he hadn't entered the gravity-inducing dance hall, with its complicated shifts between walls, floor, and ceiling, but she suspected he would handle it just as easily as he did piloting his patched-together hovercraft. \n“How so?” a large man sitting next to him asked, looking both amused and annoyed by a statement, Yillah suspected, he must have heard from his friend before. Despite the music, she could hear their conversation clearly, the Throttle following her line of sight, and amplifying the sounds from where her attention was directed in her own local wave-space. \n“The idea of humanity,” Lambent said (Yillah had pulled his name from the data-clouds), “is a construction, a tool used by the uppers to keep idiots like you chasing the tail of history, a dream of some kind of a Terran renaissance that never existed.”\nIf nothing else, Mars had good music. Tiny speakers were embedded every hands-width along the walls, causing the surfaces to ripple as bass notes traveled through them, and melodies to move physically through the room as they tripped up and down scales. Chandalier-wire hung from the upper floors, which sat on the blocky lower levels at odd angles. The Throttle, hunkering in the red wasteland under its environmental netting, was a stack of random polygonals, with the corpses of wrecked hover-cars hanging from invisible wires. In one or two, charred skeletons had been left in them, grinning at their never-ending final flight. Smaller holograms, beamed into the eyes of patrons by hidden projectors, flew overhead in insect-like pursuits. One of the walls showed feeds from the bug-races, flowing with the blurs of speed that were possible. Another showed the race tracks of Earth, vivid in the dreams of all Martians despite their never having seen them. \nOverall, the place conveyed a casino-like giddiness of motion and of risk. \n“Come sit with us,” Lambent said to her, noticing her gaze. \n~\nThey dated for months, each of them expecting the other to stop showing up for their planned rendezvous in the public theaters or sleeping rooms. There was practically no private ownership on Mars, humans sleeping in crowded hives, so liaisons were carried out in the open secrecy of guest houses and campsites, or parks and shelters in the entertainment craters. \nThings changed for both of them on a two week ride, along one of the deep canyons stretching out from the Noctis Labyrinthus, with some of Lambent's smuggler contacts and musicians that Yillah knew. They were caught in a storm, the transparent thermal tent struggling to keep the temperature at survivable levels, huge, wrathful banks of dark red dust scouring the sky above them. For several days they crouched together, running the engines of their hovercraft for warmth, listening to the frightened, instinctual chantings of the singers. Expecting to die, they lay their heads close and whispered secrets about their past and the inner lives usually kept hidden. \nThe storm passed, and Lambent realized with a sublime terror matching that of the red planet's weather, that he was in love. \nLast Race\nArgument: Lambent gets caught using a telepathic link, and is forced to leave Mars.\n\nIn the end, Lambent became too ambitious, which led to his downfall. It was a common story, and even the motivation was traditional: a woman. Yillah was from Deimos, and had run in higher circles than Lambent had ever dreamed, provoking the ire of one of the competing clans, which led to her loss of station. She never asked Lambent to win her credits, to enter the races for higher stakes, but she did accept his gifts without complaint, and showed him gratitude in return. \nHe had sold most of his cargo, and was contemplating another trip to Earth. One of the most prestigious tournaments was a long track, full of switch-backs, ramps, and loops, spiraling up the impossibly high slopes of Olympus Mons. If this novel were a video game this would be the center of it, a challenge it would take numerous tries to complete, and long nights of strategizing and junk food. Breaker, the hover-car breeder who Lambent had sold a literacy virus to, rented him one of his fastest crafts, keying its navigation to the smuggler's thoughts. He was a certified human, protected under the acts of cultural preservation, receiving special privileges from the homophilic congress of humanity's more engineered descendants. Powered by Breaker's unconventional modifications to the apergenetic alternators and thermal rods, as well as youthful ego and reckless love, he placed in one of top heats, and stood to collect a substantial prize. \nIf he hadn't been so intoxicated with victory (among other things—the months with Yillah floated on a constant stream of psycho-active drinks and additives to his breathing tanks) he wouldn't have submitted to a genetic test in order to collect his winnings. \nThe next morning the Generic committee to protect humanity sent him a summons. They had found, in his genome, the alterations that Zoa had made on Earth to protect him from the Terran toxins, and allow him communicate with telepathy. The punishment would be severe. All of his gene-credits would be seized, and for the next hundred years he would be as much of an indentured servant as a new immigrant just brought back from a stasis sleep. \n\n~\n\n“What are you going to do?” Breaker asked.\nThey were sitting on the edge of the hangar where Zoa's ship, Albedo Drift, was stored, one of thousands of pigeon holes in the side of an incomplete Tharsis crater. Below them the Sentient seeded fauna, barnacle-like crusts of oxygen-emitting fungi and pools of blue-green bacteria making the surface look like moldy bowl of mush-cakes. The more paranoid of the Martians thought that once the planet had been fully terraformed, the humans would be exterminated, and the Sentients would move in. \nLambent had already tested the ship, communing with the small packets of intelligence Zoa had infused beneath its frame. The pilot light had glowed reassuringly, the apergenetic drives purring like a sleeping animal. So far the Generic government of Mars hadn't managed to send an interdiction to the Sentients who controlled the port. It was, he feared, only a matter of time. “I could go back to Earth,” Lambent said, “but then I would never see see Yillah again.” \nSince he had met the carrier, Lambent hadn't spent much time with Breaker, other than to make modifications on the hover-cycle he was flying. Aside from the first night at Throttle, Breaker hadn't spent time with the two of them together. After Lambent had been given the notice, though, he'd called his friend and explained everything. The breeder, with his bull-dog face, took a swing from his canteen. He was in awe of the ship, walking around it in the pale greenish light, running his callused hands along the boxy stabilizers, and the sides of the cockpit.\nNo one owned anything on Mars (private property, aside from personal affects, being one of the more short-lived phenomena of human culture, recognized by all post-plastic age societies as suicidal), but most of the ships in the docking crater had been granted to particular humans by the Sentients, responding to their bio-signature. \n“Why not just go to the medical exam, and come clean to Genre? They wouldn't be too harsh, as long as you let them trim your code back to legal limits...”\nLambent shook his head. “I'd have to turn in Zoa, and the other smugglers who let me onto the surface.” He didn't tell Breaker that he liked the changes the Earth creatures had made, the feeling of connectedness he had felt in the living Biosphere of the home world, compared to which Mars and the moon were sterile chunks of rock. Remembering how it felt after he had crashed made Lambent staggeringly, suddenly, more lonely than he had ever been before. The drugs that had steeped his brain for the last few months were leeching from his system, leaving his mind as cold and distant as the disc of zombie-covered Deimos that floated above the horizon. \nBreaker sighed, sitting down next to him. He was older than Lambent, the regulating strips on in the tight-fitting jacket he always wore highlighting his muscular arms and torso. “I'm sorry I didn't warn you about the scans,” he said. “I didn't think about it. We should have bought more X brand drift feul.” Lambent ignored the last sentence, knowing that the breeder had sold part of his brain to an advertising company, so that he would involuntarily make product placements, often in grotesquely illogical or inappropriate ways.\n“Why would you? You're completely human, as far as Genre is concerned. You didn't know.” Breaker was paid, yearly, not to transcend the narrow genetic limits that the rulers of Mars had decreed faithful to historical paramaters. Turning his brain into a living commercial didn't count as an illegal augment, which, to Lambent, showed the hypocrisy of the Martian legal system. It was because Breaker was considered a real human that his brain was a marketable commodity.\nThey were silent for a while, looking at the stars, and watching the turrets occasionally shoot down an asteroid headed towards a populated area. “What about Yillah?” Breaker asked, finally. “Did you tell her about what happened on Earth?” \nLambent scowled, spitting out into the dark. “She wouldn't have turned me in,” he said. “It had to be from the race.” \nMore silence. “What was it like?” Breaker asked. “Earth?” Lambent told him, about the ruins of Megalopolis, about the jungles, the birds, the million points of intelligent light. While he was talking an idea came to him, like a cock-pit closing, like the ruins of an ancient city rising as a shelf above the evolved beauty of an inhuman world. \n“I can't stay on Mars. I can't go back to Earth,” Lambent said. “But there is another way. I can go back to the moon. I can join the Guild.”\n\nAnonymous Moon\n\nArgument: Lambent has an interview with Sehir\n\nLambent had grown up, like all Lunar citizens, familiar with the sight of the suited space-men and space-women. He was used to the opaque shields of their helmets, the unidentifiable, scrambled crackle of their voices. They were the most feared and respected syndicate on the Moon, their suits giving the impunity of the anonymous, their real bodies elsewhere, their real minds controlling a randomly assigned corpse-jacket remotely. He never thought he would be petitioning the Guild, asking to become one himself. \n“What do you plan to do for the duration of your twenty-four month contract?” the contact asked him. She (the gender only hinted at by slight bulges in the front of the suit, and a barely noticeable flaring of the hips) seemed bored, impatient with his stuttered answers. Lambent was still shaken from his flight from Mars, still half-expecting a generic officer to emerge from every corner or doorway with an order for his arrest. \n“I have...a contact,” Lambent said. “On Earth. A Sentient. She will help me smuggle artifacts to Mars.” He looked around nervously. He knew that a privacy shield surrounded their table, making their conversation inaudible and imposing images over his mouth to foil any possible lip-reading attempts, but the restaurant still seemed public. He had ordered an appetizer, long strips of vat-grown algae, but fear kept him from taking more than the occasional bite. The space-suit, of course, was unable to eat or drink. He wondered what that would be like—two years without food. \nThe Guild member flicked a gloved finger in the air, making some kind of a notation on a display he couldn't see. “You know that we'll get fifty percent, right?” she said. Lambent nodded. While gene credits were still the only real currency, the moon, less dependent on Sentient biology than Mars, could translate and pool the resources of individuals into larger transfers of non-living technology. Unlike Genre, they had cybernetic systems independent of Earth's ecosphere, and some of these resources—often raw processing power, could be “owned” by organizations like the Guild. \n“So you have enough credits on hand to pay for the drift fuel to get back from Terra...” \n“No...I mean, yes, but I'm not going to go to Earth first. I need to get back to Mars.” \nThe suit asked him why, and Lambent considered lying, and then thought better of it. “I have friends there. I want to take them with me.” The space-woman stared at him for a long time. She might have been checking something else on her internal display, or simply thinking. \n“You realize that you can't tell them who you are?” She asked. Lambent did. It was the one rule that those who joined the guild weren't allowed to break. \n“Have they seen your ship?” \nLambent told her that one of them had, but that it was a common enough species, one the Sentients grew in the thousands to freight humans and plant-life around the system. No one on Mars, neither Genre nor his friends, would be able to identify it as his. Here, Lambent was lying, and he hoped that the Guild member wouldn't be able to tell. Before he had left Mars he had told Breaker what he was planning. \nThe waiter, a zombie, came by to refill his water globe, the bluish green mold sprouting from its skin. \n“You should talk to Mr. Sehir,” the space-woman said, and Lambent knew from her tone of voice that his application would be accepted.\n\n~\nThe Guild granted his petition for asylum, and a week later Lambent stepped out of the latticed chambers of the inner moon in the hermetic suit that he would control for the next twenty years. Control, not wear, because the body inside of it wasn’t his. From then on he would be carrying in what felt like him another Guild member’s corpse, the body brought to sub-zero and only the brain kept luke-warm in the milk of cybernetic dreams. Peristaltic pressures from movement in the joints would substitute for the pumping of a heart. Inside the fish-bowl helmet, a stranger’s brain was remotely controlling some other suit (probably walking, like him, through the spiraled jelly-fish arms of the lunar caverns, lost, coming to terms with this strange new reality).\nThe helmets were synced through quantum relay, so no one knew where the biological mind perceiving any given reality-feed actually was. The location of Lambent's body was now an official secret, and would be until this round of ghosts came back to the hub for the thaw-and-switch when the contract period expired.\nThe somatics were good, his senses heightened beyond what physical eyes and ears could have produced. The surface of the suit was crawling with a film of neural micro-fibers, so the breeze from the huge vent-fans above the city, turning like slow fallen windmills, registered on what felt like skin. He could smell the metallic bite of vacuum, and feel, as if barefoot, the bone-like calcite of the nano-constructed walkways.\nThis was the cost of legal anonymity in the post-drift world. It seemed like he had gained something powerful and important, but lost something immeasurable as well. The interface through the helmet, keyed to adaptive biometrics, allowed near-telepathic communication with the other ice-bags. It was like virtual reality without the claustrophobia. Also without the possibility of escape.\nHe was just another nameless suit. A pseudo-ghost. He saw thousands of them, identical, loping along thread-like suspensions of bridges that combined low gravity with field-reversing xenofauna to create more surreal and weightless vistas than could exist anywhere planet-side. Cryo-swaps were a technique of criminal subterfuge that the Guild had been perfecting for thousands of years. Only the council could unlock the units, and before they did they monitored the stored data for breach of contract. There was only one rule: not to disclose your identity to anyone.\nOf course, everyone makes mistakes.\n\nRETURN TO MARS\nOn Mars, it was as if he were invisible. He tried to avoid the places he used to frequent before, not only because the Guild had warned him against doing so, but because it was painful to see his friends, and have them treat him like any other suit. That was the whole point, of course. The other hover-car drivers and golem-pilots he used to run with were unable to recognize him, but so were the authorities of Genre that would sentence him to death or labor camps for what he had allowed Zoa to do to his DNA. His telepathy still worked, despite the fact that his body and mind were somewhere else in the system, far away from the corpse-jacket he controlled.\nHe understood so much more now. About the guild, Earth, everything. When he had made his first smuggling run, after his ship had crashed and Zoa had saved him from the toxins of the Sentient planet, he had imagined himself and his adventure to be unique. Now, with access to the Guild's database, he realized that underneath the commerce and politics he had known about was a mirror image of that economy, illicit and underground. The Guild's ties with the Sentients went deeper than he had ever suspected. Not only did they tolerate breaking the laws the Martian government set for humanity, but they encouraged it. Some kind of illegal activity was a prerequisite, in fact, for joining—that was how the ensured loyalty and secrecy. The Lunar council would, for the rest of his life, have power over him through the threat of blackmail. The Martians couldn't touch him, because the body with which he was committing crimes wasn't his own. That was the genius of the Lunar system. They, however, could decrypt the quantum relay, and expose him anytime they chose. \nHe did go to back to Throttle, once, knowing from the Guild's data cloud that Breaker would be there. Whether or not the ship-breeder recognized him or not, he knew enough about how the suit-system worked not to let on. He described the triangular run he was planning, between Mars, Earth, and the Lunar colony, and Breaker nodded silently as if he were hearing it for the first time, as if Lambent hadn't discussed a similar plan in the same bar, months before. When Lambent took him to see the ship, he ran his hands over it and looked at the scans with the same admiration he had before, with perhaps a shade more sincerity. The ship had changed, grown in size and complexity on his last visit to the planet-side Biopolis.\nOn Earth he had met other humans, likewise locked in suits, and those who had given up their humanity altogether to roam with bands of biomorphing nomads. He had sat on the edges of rocky plateaus and looked up at the cratered disk of light in the sky that contained his past. Finally he felt like the pieces of his puzzled life were falling into place. As a child he had watched the space-suits, not thinking of them as people but more as extrusions from the moon itself, part of the machines and the frozen landscape that were the backdrop of his family's existence, an impersonal extension of the powers that controlled them. He understood now their stillness and silence, exposed to the flows of data and sensory waves that they were fixated on as they stepped slowly along the scaffoldings in their large, magnetic boots. He moved like them, and his thoughts were beginning to conform to the powerful, pervasive patterns beamed from the datahubs buried in the Lunar rock.\nMaybe Breaker recognized him, but sensed that he had changed. He was a ghost, lost somewhere in the cybernetic circuits of the Guild. The ship-grower agreed to go with him, believing, or pretending to believe, that his record with the hover-races justified his recruitment for a smuggling mission. Lambent had realized his friend was in debt with the gene-markets, but now he knew exactly how bad the situation was. He, through the guild, had access to the DNA sequences of nearly every licensed citizen on the surface. Those in the floating pyramid-cities, of course, were beyond the ken of even the Guild hackers and decryptors. The thing that worried him was that he should have been able to find Yillah in the records, but couldn't. Her history was there, the sad story of her slow climb out of the genetic underclasses, but shortly after he had left Mars her trail went dark. \nFinally, on of the traces he had placed paid off. She was in a port near Nix Olympica, trying to book passage to one of the pleasure-yachts of Earth owned by the Martian syndicate. She was also, he was dismayed to learn, pregnant. \n\n\nZoa \nOn a planet that had become a giant telepathic system, there were still some nodes that were dark. Ur-trees were invisible to their empathy, emitting only a kind of self-enwrapping hum. They had grown unchanged since the most distant ages, corpses of their ancestors compressed under deep forgetful layers of earth, until the dreams become electric. \nRecently, the unthinking trees had begun to surge with apergenetic sap, drift energy, rising slowly, sacrificing some of their smaller and less senior roots in their desire to get closer to the sun. The thick tendrils now were columns between the rising layers. Underneath, ruins of the ancient ages, including the human, had begun to be exposed. \nZoa was a kind of historian, and had been drawn to the elevated sites, which usually held a kind of superstitious dread for Earth-sentients. Research was life or death, in that the total biomass he could occupy, roughly correlating with the frontal lobe tissue that could be psychically networked, depended on an individual identity/thought-sequence being accepted by its ecology. She had been, for most of her existence, a population of water-beetles. Sometimes evolving to push up the fast-flowing wrists of river deltas, into the marshy inland ponds, or growing wings and following breezes and smaller food-sources out to the salty air above the ocean, Zoa had once been given access to the genetic code of a turtle, almost as much of an honor as becoming a dolphin or a parrot flock would have been. \nIt took all of her sentience to inhabit, however, so she preferred less risky distributions of brain tissue, sometimes living as both a family of lizards, cloud of butterflies, or tribe of parasites. When she found the suit, near the wreckage of the Guild cruiser, she was a few dozen millipedes and some large, stinging insects. \n~Motiv\n\nLord Motiv's father had taught him about the responsibilities of wealth and power. Four generations ago his family had come to Mars, immigrant labor confined to a lifetime of dangerous drudgery in the terraforming towers, neither human enough to win favor with the Lunar or Terran, overlords, nor advanced enough to compete with the older Martian families. Motiv's grandfather had, according to which of his relatives was telling the story, either gradually earned his mods, augments, and sky-service passes by dint of his tireless and clever industry, or had won the favor of a local crime-boss by informing on a leader of the strikes and protests during the needle-worm blight, when half of the Martian labor force starved. Either way, his grandparents had earned enough to send his father to Earth for Sentient schooling, a mark of the new inter-planetary elite. \nFor most of the Bloodless era and the subsequent 40,000 year Slow-down, re-engineering humanoid genetics had been illegal. Now, it was merely expensive. Inconceivably so for most of the lower and slower classes, whose life-span, proprioception speeds, and cognitive capacities were a fraction of the nobles'. \nThe era of crude resource extraction was over. The Earth had long ago been stripped of any fungible reserve of oil, trees, or naturally occurring animal stocks. For a brief period, after the ancient Geo-engineering projects of Mars were discovered to have been running in the long absence of their builders (evolving into the tiny niches of subterranean gases and liquid underneath the dry red crust before fluorescing into a nitrogen-fixing ecology), it seemed that history might repeat itself, with a new virgin planet to deplete. \nThe second wave of Martian colonists, however, tens of thousands of years after their predecessors had suffocated when the domes had cracked, saw in legal precedent the basis of more wealth and power than any material benefit the new-found environments could have produced. The Xenians that had evolved during the postponement, when the old human race had sent themselves into a headless sleep, were understandably resentful of renascent Bloodless-era homo sapiens splicing the new, hard-earned genes into their own weak bodies. Their physiologies were the birthright of thousands of years of toil, death, and struggle, countless generations passing while the ancient humans simply floated in their freezing buckets underground, waiting for the planet to recover, and their long-term investment in the future to mature. Laws had been passed to the effect that the Xenians owned the genetics their ancestors had wrested from the cold laws of natural selection. This led to centuries of virtual enslavement for the resurrected species, as the Xenians sold the new mutations to homo sapiens, who found themselves to be a new genetic underclass.\nWith the rediscovery of Mars, enterprising humans saw the opportunity to turn the tables. Because their species had been the ones to set the original terraforming in motion, the results of any subsequent evolution, even after tens of thousands of years, belonged to them. Interplanetary politics had, by the time Motiv was born, resolved themselves into an uneasy trilateral balance, with Xenians, the new Martian corporations, and the cyborgs, including the Guild syndicates, engaging in perpetual plays for power through sabotage, genetic warfare, and economics. \nMotiv, his parents told him, was destined to be one of the rulers of the universe. \n~Tharsis \nARGUMENT: Breaker's backstory. Lambent tries to sell him an illegal literacy augment, and then meets Yillah dancing by the raceways. He has to flee before he can see her again, joining the Guild.\nBreaker was from one of the more common periods of human history, so he wasn't worth much genetically, but he was from far back enough in the Postponement to make a living on Mars, putting on a show for Xenians from Earth that wanted to see a glimpse of what life was like for their barbarian ancestors. There were similar areas on Earth, according to rumor, although conspiracy theorists would have him believe that the footage of those ghost cities had been faked. On Mars, he'd worked as a bio-mechanic, pilot, and various underpaid entrepreneurial endeavors he would rather forget.\nHe'd been out of the jar for ten years now. He'd been alive for fifty, stretched over a period of roughly 40,000. They brought his mind back before his body—running him through a series of cognitive modules to get him up to speed on the status of the solar system, 30,000 years after the peak of human civilizations and technology. There weren't many options for sub-sentient exiles, except to eventually hope for some posh diplomat position on a Jovian moon, or landing a gig on one of the inter-planetary cruises, on which the Sentients sometimes paid for human games and re-enactments, part of a prehistoric theme. He chose Mars rather than the moon, the lunar caves reminding him too much of the Slow-down doom-scape on Earth when he had first started his jumps. \nBreaker had felt disoriented when he thawed, as if he had been tricked somehow, lied to about his past, as if too many wires had been glued together. He would never be able to see Earth again except in the games and telescopes. Now, looking out over the impact-blasted surface, shelves of it carved by thinking nanite-swarms into geometric slabs, he lamented that time travel went only one way, and that he would never see his wife or sister again. Underneath the spray of the waterfalls and xenofauna eyes glinted. \nHe met Lambent at one of the Tharsis markets, temporary low-gravity structures blooming from the red walls of the crater, hanging down in long displays of vegetables, clothing, and ancient technology. \n“What does this do?” Breaker asked Lambent, pointing to a kind of thumb-screw thimble. He wasn't wearing his mask yet, but Breaker would have no clear memories of the half-zombie, so he might as well already have been behind the reflective helmet with its incomprehesible pattern of inner lights.\n“Augment,” Lambent answered, hips cocked in a pose that would survive the transfer to the exo-suit. Both he and Breaker were wearing over-sized mag-boots, without which they would be blown off the thin metal gangways, monorails veining the red clay, looping into spirals laid against the crater walls of Tharsis. There was more apergy here than in any other one of Breaker's incarnations, although more could be done with less drift-feul in Martian gravity, especially with help from post-human technology and Sentient micrological biomass.\n“What for?” Breaker asked. Literacy, Lambent told him. They stared at each other, like different species on an alien world, wary of attacks and camouflage. Literacy is illegal, Breaker mumbled, finally, almost like a question.\n“A lot of things are illegal,” the smuggler answered. “The taboo, though, only applies to Earth. On the moon, everyone can read. There are ways around the virus.”\nBreaker was unsure. Financially, his classification as human was, for the moment, his only asset and hope for survival. Lambent, unsure if the older man was bargaining for price, told him about the Megalopolis where the loot had come from, an ancient human city unearthed by the rising forests. They exchanged information, but didn't close a deal.\nLater, at a low-gravity dance party out by the casinos and racetracks, Lambent had met Yillah, and they had stayed up all night, talking, laying under the thin atmospheric dome that was keeping out an eternity of cold, Sentient posts occasionally destroying meteors with long graphite spars like harpoons, shots lancing out into the velvet dark. They promised to meet the next day, at the fountain, but before then Lambent had to run away from Genre agents who had tracked some of the artifacts back to him, taking a Guild ship to the moon, and having his body frozen on arrival. \n~Yillah \n“There is no way of knowing anything on Mars,” Yillah said, a phrase that she would often use dismissively, angrily, or as a philosophical mantra. She hadn't trusted Lambent, although, if she were looking for people she could trust, she wouldn't have gone to the racetrack. Yillah owed enough money to Genre that the kind of business she was looking for precluded trust, which would not have benefited either party. \nShe was a noble grifter of the red planet and a demi-queen of Deimos. Generally, she lived by the rule of only stealing from those who would have stolen from her first, but something about Lambent, his arrogant inexperience, made him an exception. Now she looked over the Sentient and human crowds at the fountain park, the disk of Phobos visible in the half-lit sky, realizing he wouldn't show, and she wouldn't have a chance to report his illegal artifacts to Generic agents. Chances were, someone beat her to the punch. There was no way of knowing anything on Mars.\nLaw enforcement on the red planet was a crowd-sourced spy and bounty network, and many humans and sub-sentients took to reporting violations as a way of reducing their indebtedness to the hack-factories and crime lords. Morality in such a system became unaccountable. Months before she had been robbed by an ex-lover, a lunar executive, who had come back, contrite, after losing it on a hover-car bet. She had broken his nose.\nLambent, as a potential partner in sex or criminality, barely registered, and she never thought about him again, until the space-suit, on Earth, whispered that name, in violation of his contract. He had come back, thinking he would save her, and instead doomed her to a death at the hands of Genre.\n“You can't know anything on Mars,” Yillah said to Breaker, the first time she met him in the hanger on Tharsis Plate. This referred to two things the bio-pilot had just done: apologized for assuming that the child she was carrying was hers, and expressed shock that Sentients would let them land on Earth. The first utterance had been an embarrassed mutter, the second a gruffly articulated cover-up of the preceding awkwardness. \nHover-bikes, with huge, antique boom-engines and cracked chasses hung from cables near the ceiling, and rose from polished pedestals from the otherwise grimy corrugated floor. Ochre dust traced at a distance the influence of the idling or lifting ships. Racing was huge on Mars, with an intense rivalry with the moon. Breaker, when he introduced himself, had said he had worked at one of the tech-parks, which Yillah considered the Sentient's way of laughing at humanity. \nShe stared at Breaker's radiation-smoothed features, unaugmented pores, and opaque red lenses, wondering if she resented him because he was still human, and she had traded her classification long ago for a shot at the races, the improbable bid the most optimistic of extinct Earth organisms to earth literate and telepathic traits. The buffer zone surrounding acknowledged and legally protected humanity was a brutal territory, a border controlled by unscrupulous Sentients and hypocritical humans, and the odds were stacked against those, like Yillah, who hadn't even been born before the exile from Earth.\nThe pilot, too old for her even if he weren't still human, had a thin row of projectors carved just below his eye, above the cheek-bones. Mars was like a less virulent version of the memetic age of Earth, when hyper-capitalistic ideologies combined with a fluid interface between reality and versions of it augmented or altered by a sometimes invisible layer of cybernetic mediation. Megalopolis, in its various incarnations, almost always had an involuntary technological filter, in the same way that cognition had been limited and channeled through legal mandates. Breaker's lenses gestured towards the human age, while acknowledging its artificiality, and its obsolescence in the face of post-human bio-mancy. Telepathy trumped technology, and human-made augments would only take a species so far. Breaker didn't ask her any more about the baby. She had gotten pregnant out of desperation, as a way to earn some credit with Genre. She followed one of the flickering posts one of the public rock-murals, interpreting a criminal code in the encrypted advertisement, and was flown up one of the spikes to a zero gravity medical theater, where she was impregnated with a clone of Lord Motiv, fourth son of the Genre ambassador, to whom she was to deliver the undelivered fetus. The improbably muscled generic agents gave her medicine to take daily to keep the fetus from coming to term. A nine month gestation period would take only three to four weeks, due to the highly accelerated growth rate of the clone, which once born would be the size of a fully grown man in six years.\n“We're cleared,” the space-man said, carrying a coiled and belted pack three times his size, heavy even on Mars. His mag-boots made reverberating percussions along the hive of connected hangars. Breaker and Yillah picked up their packs, the pregnant woman bending carefully. Her hair was pulled into two conical spikes from the base and back of her skull, making her resemble, vaguely, a sea creature. Her initial credit after shedding her legal humanity had been spent, not on beauty augments in hopes of whoring herself to wealthy humans, but into combat and cognitive upgrades. \n“Is that your ship?” Yillah asked. They were standing by the pads of an enormous freighter, worn but magestic, with graceful wing-lines diverging into rudders, stabalizers, and spoilers. \n“No,” Lambent said from inside the helmet, in a voice neither of them would recognize as the moon-boy they had met a year ago, who had tried to sell them fenced artifacts of the expansion age. The door to the cargo bay of the freighter slowly slid upwards, like the wing of a beetle, and they followed the suit up a ladder to the docking platform. They walked along a dimly marked path around clunky, box-shaped ships, most of which were half-dismantled piles of metal bones and dormant bio-mass. \n“This is my ship,” Lambent said, pointing to one particularly dilapidated wreck, whose only hope for viable flight lay in a vine-like shell and scaffolding of secondary, post-human tinkering. \n“Seriously?” Yillah asked. \n~Earth\nThe Continuity was a cramped, uncertain ship, a thorax of a deck and two drift engines above and slightly behind the square stabalizers, encrusted with flaking residue from the membrane, like the bark tearing off two burnt ur-tree trunks. Lambent had the varying opacity of the helmet to distract him, archives of the Eidolon to explore, and Breaker had his lenses, and the ship to figure out. \nBreaker wasn't sure why the space-suit had hired him. He had insinuated that he and Breaker had met before, but as a Guild member he was unable to reveal his former identity, for a period of six years. He was sure that the spaceman was holding something back, and that he must have some contact with the Sentients on Earth, since the ship obviously hadn't been built by humans, and Martian super-species wouldn't let such a ship, wreck or not, fall into the hands of sub-sentients. \nZoa was, in a sense, on board, synaptic loops running as concurrent charges through the logic of the engines, and could communicate with Lambent from her main biomass on Earth. She told him that the ship was being followed, and the ship, either Guild or Genre, was monitoring all of their systems. \nLambent, when they woke up on Earth, would apologize for agreeing to the sea-turtle's plan, until Yillah had dismantled all of his rationalizations and excuses. He had lied to them, betrayed them, and used them. He had also ruined her life, and she didn't care who he had been before he became a frozen corpse. The three of them had six years for reviews and recriminations, migrating along the hidden corridors, running from Lord Motiv and the larger animals, Zoa and her raiders protecting them in exchange for their help identifying and peddling artifacts. \nThe feeds from the hacked systems had to be realistic sounding, Zoa argued. He couldn't tell Breaker or Yillah what was going to happen. With the ship the way it was, a crash on Earth was plausible. \nThey were asleep, and the alarms sounded. Yillah woke up Breaker, and they dove down one of the access corridors onto the deck, and started asking the space-suit what was going on. The boots and joints were locked into place, and the helmet was completely still and silent, swaying with the ship like a jellyfish. Lights pulsed slowly in the dark, indecipherable. \n“We're in strato,” Breaker said, looking through his lenses at screens, seeing trajectories of incineration. \n“What did you do?” Yillah shouted at the immobile suit. \n“If you are in there,” the bio-pilot said, knowing that the ship could communicate, “help us. Tell us what is going on.” Yillah thought he was talking to the spaceman. The Continuity became bathed in white, and steam rose from the walls of the deck, with their ferns and flowers. Oxygen levels dropped, and Breaker lost consciousness, his red lenses disappearing, revealing closed and swollen lids. Yillah held onto the stiff shoulders of the suit, her fury rising in sympathy with the nearly melting chassis and controls.\nShe passed out, fell, and Lambent caught her. \n“The cameras,” Zoa warned him, telepathically, but Lambent refused to let her go. Vines and hardening cellular sap shot out of the walls, like the eyes-talks of snails, securing Yillah and Breaker. \n“I could put you out for the crash,” the Sentient thought to him.\n“No,” Lambent said, letting the vegetation brace him. The guild, if it ever put together what happened, could find him guilty of putting the body he had switched with in danger. It was worth the risk, he thought, to lose whoever it was that was following them. \nThe dark blue of the ocean bubbled up below them, and the pursuer, whoever it was, peeled off their trail, convinced of their immanent and watery demise. \nZoa and the raiders saw the Continuity streak across the sky, and the Sentient did her best to make them splash gently, near where they could be reached. Much of the integrity damage to the hull had been faked, and she was able to keep the ship floating, with sufficient oxygen, before the sea-turtles arrived to carry them to the Island. \n“You planned this?” Breaker asked, strapped to the shell of a flying turtle. \n“Yes,” Lambent said, riding the back of Zoa. \nYillah was still out, in a cot carried by two deep-sea fish, like the finned body of horses. “We were being trailed, “Lambent said, “and the feed had been hacked. I would have told you, but...”\n“It had to sound convincing,” Breaker said, closing his eyes against a headache, hoping not to vomit upside down. After several minutes, they landed on a shell-strewn margin of beach.\n“Why aren't we dead?” Breaker asked the suit, after the sun had set and they had Scaped together a damp fire of drift wood. The suit had been sitting near the turtle, Zoa, who had rolled herself a cozy declivity in the sand.\n“Is this your first time on Earth?” Lambent asked. The bio-pilot didn't answer. “The toxins take a while to take affect. By that time the Sentients will have given you and Yillah resistances. Temporary: it won't endanger your humanity.\nSome of the raiders had been living, with small parts of their psychic matrix, as fish, and, as the fire died down, they swam as far up the beach as the tide would allow, and flopped next to Lambent's boots. The Space-man killed and gutted them, laying the meat across rocks wet within the coals. \n“Why are they helping us?” Breaker asked. He had agreed to come with Lambent to Earth, knowing it was illegal, because he had always wanted to see it for himself. Now he had, it seemed terrifying and hostile, but mixed with the fear was an awe and humility at a cognizant ecology. Lambent explained that despite what the Martians and Moonies wanted their colonies to believe, not all Sentients supported the taboo. Besides, he went on, it was more human technology that the Sentients were afraid of, and the larger species had been flaunting the laws for years by allowing the floating bases of the decayed human empires. \nThe next day they moved inland, Breaker reveling despite himself in the green atmosphere and raw chaos of un-terraformed terra. Breaker went out with Zoa, scouting some ruins, and when he came back Breaker met him, warning him that Yillah had woken up, and she was furious. They heard her yelling before they got close to where they had set up camp by some boulders near a stream. \n“What's wrong?” Lambent asked her, not understanding what she was saying.\nShe had been taking medicine, daily, to keep from going into labor. Lambent, with his plan, his deception, his betrayal, his collabGinqualon with the Sentients, had kept her unconscious for a full day. She was going to give birth to a cloned crime-boss who had been tweaked for accelerated growth, and was never supposed to develop brain activity.\nLambent still didn't understand why she was so upset. She would lose her contract, but they could make more than that with archaeological raids. The baby could be taken care of somehow.\n“This baby!” Yillah screamed, “is living proof of every illegal gene-hack Lord Motiv has had. Proof that the ideology of the red planet is a lie! Do you think Genre will just let us live?”\nNo, Lambent supposed, they wouldn't. On the other hand, they weren't going to let her live anyway, had she delivered the clone to Motiv. \n\n\n \nBOOK TWO: DRIFT\n\n“Everything will change.”\n\n\n \nTRANSPOSITIONS\n\nThe stories kept arriving for Malwise, along with the telegrams from Merfield telling him that he no longer worked for Merfield and Raum, publishers, and he must return all of their property immediately. The stories were sent from Your Dreadful Lily, accompanied by long letters, cryptically bemoaning her wedded life. Her husband had forbidden her to write fiction or letters since their infant son had died.\nMalwise, as they traveled West on the train, continued to try to sell upcoming editions, by subscription, to serialized novelizations of these stories, knowing that they would never come. He was becoming a con man. Returning to his old ways, he thought ironically to himself. He carried blocks of wood in fancy leather covers, embossed and with a content sheet pasted on the inside. \nHe began to sense something behind what she was describing in her letters, and even behind the strange code of fiction he thought he had deciphered. \nI have recurring dreams, one of the letters said, although sometimes they are waking. I am a woman far in the future, named Yillah, who is carrying a child that isn't hers. Humans aren't allowed on Earth, which had evolved beyond them, and is filled with thousands of intelligent species, not just one. I'm going to turn this into a story, which I'll mail to you, if I can get it past my husband. \nI still am not in love with you, Lily's epistle mentioned later, I am writing because I am lonely, like the human species exiled to Martian zoos and Lunar caverns. There are enough wars and pulling up of trees here to make me think that the future will be like that, all human cities buried under alien growth. You used to talk about evolution. I wish I could see you. Don't come, however, or my husband will murder you. \nThe train groaned and lifted. Orlando and Zabella were reading, reflected in the window, with the Pushman logo between the two versions of them, backwards. The night clouds were laid out line lines of print below them, the electric lights getting smaller, as the ones above their heads grew brighter, as the engine used its own gravity against the Earth's.\nMalwise looked again at the coins on the table. They weren't any cast he recognized, and neither the language nor the seal on the reverse side looked familiar. The man he had met, wearing the odd jacket, had said he simply came from...a city far away. \nI am becoming more afraid of doors. Whenever I walk through one I feel framed, like it is a transition, and maybe I won't clearly remember the room that I just left. The only solution, it would seem, would be to live outside, because trees don't ever grow into doorways, and the only roof of canyons is the stars. \nAfter he had read that he had left the train room, and walked along the railed gangway on the outside of the cars, where he could feel the speed and look down at the Earth. The fake-doctor suddenly felt a superstitious fear different from the one that Lily described, a terror of windows, suddenly struck by a fantasy that he would peer into them as he shuffled by, and in the reflection of each would be a different version of himself, and a different backdrop of fast-moving scenery. In one he might see a prehistoric Earth, or the surface of Mars. \n~Broca/Lombarqo\nThe Capitano of the Comedians, the illustrious Lombarqo, began to drink heavily. Lucrezia would glare at him from the wagon, as he pulled his flask out every few plods of the donkey's hooves. While he was drunk, Lombarqo had visions of being a zombie. Not cannibal zombies, like those in the romances, but savage undead that had fallen victim to strange, fungal growths, bright green infections under their fingernails and in the mucus membranes of the eyes, nose, and mouth. They wanted to kill but not to eat. In diet, they were the strictest vegetarians. \nHe told Grazano and his nephew, along with Lucrezia, explaining that most of the humans left on Earth had, at some point, sent themselves long distances into the future, and that occasionally the process resulted in brain damage. There were the ruins of ancient cities, mummified somehow by an invisible layer. He told them that, when he had dreams or drunken visions of this dimension, he was a zombie, but one who could read the minds of other zombies, and was beginning to become more self-aware. He was beginning to be able to control, not only his own body, but those of others. What he left out was that, in these visions, he was a woman.\nTo Lombarqo, it would be hard for him to explain how liberating it had felt, not only to experience sex from the view of a woman, but having the complete shut down of higher brain function. Only the drive to reproduce, and a latent potential for violence. There were stories of the undead in Lombarqo's time, as there were stories of ghosts, skeletal armies and ghouls held in necromantic thrall by some African shaman. In none of those stories had sex played a major part, and yet when Lombarqo drifted back, head snapping up with a wine-jug clattering to the stones, protected from breaking only by the woven grass, it was usually visions of sex or gore that he snapped back from. \nWhat was the mire from which humanity arose, and to which it appeared destined to descend?\nLombarqo had no religion except for a vague sense of transmigrational karma, and human death, especially on battle-fields, something souls had to endure once or twice at most. And yet, as Broca, which was the name the zombie woman had for herself, he had memories of dying more times than he could count. \nLombarqo stared up at the sky, trees growing out of the shoulders of Ginqualo, Grazano, and Rosla. He had fallen off his donkey. \nThey were traveling across a near-desert of olive, sage, and grasses. As the sun was gnawing on the hills, they decided to camp, pulling the canvases of the wagon and making them into tents. The traveling stage had sustained little damage from the rapids, and their narrow escape from Udolo's killers. \nLucrezia had taken out yards of thin cloth from the costume trunk to use as barriers between the still-powerful sunlight, and the insects that would plague them as it weakened. The Dottore was in good spirits, practicing his lazzi on farmers and shepherds returning to their cottages. Lombarqo, somewhat recovered, took out his guitar, singing loud enough to drown out the fake-doctor's monologue, to the delight of the crowd of dirt-covered adolescents, whose farming implements were kept more clean than their hands or faces. \nThe Capitano, pulling his mask and cod-piece from the trunk, started bellowing songs of the Spanish infantry. Rosaletta climbed onto the now-cleared stage and began to dance, bells chiming from a dozen strategic places. Ginqualo took romantic postures and harmonies, and Lucrezia, to upstage them, bent into backward handsprings and bridges, holding the harlequin's cap out for coins with her toes in a gesture that was, in the case of this crowd, purely perfunctory. \nThe competition between the acts was itself an act, as rehearsed and formulaic as its elements, and ended in only one way: mock violence. The Arlecchino's batte against the dottore's wagging finger, or Lucrezia, in the costume of the rogue, being thrown by the dottore off the stage, over the heads of the astonished audience. \nLucrezia had jumped, contrary to the stage illusion, Grazano's grip on her costume tight but his arms and shoulders lose, followering her lead as she ran, bent over, to the edge of the stage and then springing outward, having earlier checked the spot on the ground for any hidden stones or sticks, tucking her shoulders, and only when certain that she was in control of the fall splaying her limbs out randomly, as if the victim of unhappy chance. \nThe farmers applauded, then left, but Grazano signalled that they should keep rehearsing. “Ipso quid, vorbis manumantis, as the greek oratician once said, which means that in the end all stages are dark, all play-houses empty. The following is called secret cities, about a world that has postponed itself, like a mummy kingdom, leaving sub-human zombies to roam among machines once used in a bloodless war.”\nThe captain took the stage, not speaking, staring directly out through his mask at the invisible audience, trying to see the world that haunted his alcoholic and nocturnal visions, but all that came to mind was a crowded cellar, and a human head floating in a jar. \n~Sehir/Merfield\n\nMr. Sehir woke up as Mr. Merfield. \nHe knew who he was. He didn't have amnesia. His cognition felt a little cluttered, but his physical brain was more than capable of running with twinned self-perceptions. This is, to Mr Merfield/Sehir, what it felt like: as if he had been having recurring dreams, since childhood, that he was a person, living in a different world. Each night, he would remember a lifetime's worth of nocturnal memories, consistently reassembled, and each morning he would forget them, until he fell asleep. \nIn the sun slanting through the Eastern window, he would hold the routed curves of the mirrored oak dresser, the varnish faded under his grip, and try to reassemble his identity. He was a publisher, in debt to the bank, engaged in speculations with the railroads and drift mines in the West. Every Thursday he went to a booster club, and Tuesdays were meetings of the local lodge. \nTwo nights ago Mr. Merfield had been visited by an ominous cadre of characters, representatives of finance, industry, government, Blinkertons, and the police, and given explicit instructions not to publish anything that suggested inter-dimensional travel was possible.\nMr. Sehir, in turn, deep in the purple-shaded moon, had been paid a visit by the Guild council representatives, concerned how the politics with Mars and Earth would be effected. Now, as Merfield, he had an opportunity to find out. The goal, for both of them, was market share, to prevail against those they felt were a threat or danger. \nMerfield spoke to no one. He never suspected his sanity, although he did wonder how much of Sehir's criminal empire on the moon, in what appeared to be more than 60,000 years in humanity's future, had been suggested by the meeting with the captains of industry, or the “robber-barons,” as the Penny Dreadfuls and broadsheets called them. \nThe publisher was looking down at the street, lines of laundry strung from windows, when he saw Pushman, owner of a railway, a meat packing plant in Chicago, and several factory towns, walk out of an expensive carriage, the driver waiting in slightly offended dignity while his benefactor conducted business with the lesser sort of men. Merfield was glad he couldn't see his bowing and Scraping as the financier, who seemed to have fingers of steel as well as fingers in steel, shook his hand and looked him in the eye. The businessman's suit was immaculately tailored and pressed, but some dandruff had settled lightly on the shoulders, along with one or two gray hairs. The starch made his collars stand up in an extraordinary fashion. \nHe had fired all of his work-force, except for the boy who set the type, so he asked if Pushman wanted coffee, prepared to make it himself. The robber-baron declined.\n“Ice-water?”\n“No.” He sighed wearily, tapping the corner of the publisher's desk with his cane. He was wearing a yellow cape. \n\n~Hoverpilot\n\nIda and Evrim Azqa, fleeing the rioting illiterate chaos of their city, were making their way through tunnels and over thin bridges suspended over the crowded intersections of stalled-out hover-cars. The Yazisiz virus was cutting the last legs out of a world whose hope had been poisoned and eroded by ecological catastrophe. \nThey were hitchiking with a young improbably bearded man, possibly Simoan, who didn't speak English. It was the middle of summer, and they had been out of water when the man stopped. The radio was on, some long-frequency set up, rabbit ears and self-assembled dials and relays crackling out a language neither Ida nor Evrim understood. Occasionally there would be a ukelele or a flute, warping the static as if pulling it into tune. \nThe object-oriented auto-matedness of many aspects of the 23rd century, bemoaned by hyper-literates like Ida and Evrim, ended up working to the city's advantage after the virus struck. The driver piloted his almost comically small craft, with Ida and Evrim in a kind of basket behind him.\nThey talked as the sun set in front and to the left of them, as they headed in the general direction they were going, where Ida's daughter, Kamala, had a defunct RV parked somewhere in the woods. She had lived there with an artist for a while, before she married BorQs. Now she was in the Himalayas, researching one of the highest ur-tree groves. They would, unless a way was found between the ecological zones, never see their daughter again.\n“All those books,” Evrim said. Ida hummed. “The stories are getting all confused in my mind, from trying to remember them. Something else, too...”\nHe stopped, looking out the window. He asked what Ida was thinking. She put together a sequence of gazes: at the speeding track outside, the obstacles they were narrowly veering around, the face of hairy driver, which combined with her flashed expression of patient amusement meant: I am glad we found a way to travel, but I hope that we are safe. They were on what appeared to be an old hover-car race-track from the expansionist days. Some of the most ridiculous things had survived. So many of the essentials now seemed to be collapsing. \nThe bearded islander was an expert pilot: using the solar-charged bursts they had stored up sparingly. The craft they were on was (supposedly) designed for low-speeds, and couldn't lift itself far from any surface. This low tolerance for obstruction was compensated for by excellent steering, using the now-darkened solar sheets like sails, guiding the craft on impossible curves, far above the busier lanes below them. \nOut loud, she said, “I was thinking about how we will know things now, without being able to read them. Will the news be more reliable, or less? After it happened, when we were watching the reports after the virus had infected everyone, I noticed that what the different stations were saying, it was actually different. Before, it was always the same. We've always had free speech, supposedly, but...”\n“It seems more free now that no one can read?” Evrim said. \nThen he told her about the ice apes, about the Linguists and the Telepaths. He said he couldn't remember where he had read it, although it seemed familiar. As he spoke he was trying to measure Ida's reaction, which was composed, but thoughtful. “In a way,” Evrim said, “writing is to speech as speech is to telepathy.”\n“What was 8rto doing?” she asked. \n“Looking for someone named TreLa4, who was a telepath. He was with Te2ao, looking for her. ..”\n“Just think,” Ida said, “If we could meet, as ice apes, we could read one another's minds.” \nNow that we can't read or write, Evrim thought, we'll speak to each other more. That, itself, is a kind of telepathy. \nThe hovercraft pilot smiled, so maybe he did understand French after all. \n\n\nThe problem of Continuity Drift, from a novelistic sense, is different than the observable effects of dimensional transpositions, especially the early psychic swaps that constituted the initial stage. An author might change a character's name, or prune a branch of plot, the phantom limb of which would cause a dissonance, but if you drifted into another planar mind, that consciousness would be completely different than your own. There were no versions of yourself or your life you could slip into, with one choice reversed. \nNot that there wasn't a kind of placebo effect when people started learning about the dimensional slips. There was no way to prove that your life hadn't been radically different, say, two seconds ago, before the trans-spatial matrix shifted, according to some eldrich tectonics, and now your family had been replaced with strangers, or your dog with a cat, or your home town with a power plant. \nAnother odd thing that I will tell you, to avoid confusion: later, in Book Three, physical travel occurs between the dimensions and chapters of the novel, but for each dimension that is paired in mental transpositions, that world will be inaccessible by the gates or storms. There are figures for this, that I have drawn over and over, to keep it straight in my head: the continuities A,B,C, X,Y, and Z in a hexagonal pattern, with two triangles mapping the coming physical shifts, and arrows showing the mind-drifts of book two. \nIn reality, the bondings and valencies between dimensions is more complicated, but I am borrowing the simplified design employed by novels of the Drift, which, fortunately, no one from your dimension has ever read. \nI am in the odd position of being forced to pretend to be more original than I actually am, since your dimension, just beginning to touch the verge, would never acknowledge that the conventions I am referring to, established by an inter-dimensional literary tradition now nearly a decade old, were available online with the right software. Lily Lovelis, as the following chapters will reveal, faced a similar position when she was abducted by California bandits and taken to their hide-out on a prehistoric Earth. In the Megalopolis, I also plan on writing about how Kamala, working for the last hold-outs of Capital, found herself researching the same open-source networks her ex-husband, BorQs, used for gaming. The corporate algorithms for digital rights management (prosecuting and intimidating on behalf of copyright law) detected anomolies—unlicensed and unexpected bursts of creative material by populations that should have been too beaten down by poverty, work, and resource shortage...\nThe one law, though, about dimensional travel that I'm using in this narrative and that is true in the worlds that I have knowledge of, is that if you dream about it, you will never set foot there. \n~TreLa4 \nIn terms of the hexagonal symmetry, the Starship story doesn't fit. It is a seventh, hidden, dimension, that I admit has a kind of priority over the rest. It deals with the same question, though: what are the limits of humanity, and given evolutionary distance, what is the value of remaining human? TreLa4 is a post-human inhabitant of a mega-planet, a near-immortal hive-mind sailing through trans-dimensional space. \nThere are other themes or dynamics I find interesting about the story arc, so I wanted to leave it in, along with other spanning interludes like the bridge sections, even though it disrupts the pattern. Some chaos, as a result of my preference as an author, can represent the irregularities in real inter-dimensional physics that I can't really speak to.\nYou can tell I have authority to tell you what this novel is really about, because I'm speaking in italics.9 Despite what certain editors may whisper after the real work of composition has been completed, these italicized insertions represent a direct epistolary address, to the readers at a certain stage of drafting. One might even say that italics are leaning towards the author, a rather disorganized slob to be honest, and his own private notes to himself, as to problems of continuity and exposition that need to be fixed, holes in the fabric that need to be mended if the narrative is to be useful and warm. \nSo every story arc will be divided into four parts, in the corresponding books. On the starship Continuity, TreLa4 has become obsessed with a particular species in the archive, namely humans. She has lost her status with the Sentient swarms, and is working processing alien ships from the docks when she meets a troupe of actors, who seem to have survived a thousand-year journey with no stasis equipment. That all happened in the first part. In the second, the players leave to travel to the rim, and TreLa4 and the telepathic jelly fish (encased in a humanoid space-suit) decide to follow them. \nThe telepathic jelly-fish had appropriated some obsolete stiff-legged space-suits from the lockers, with exaggerated magnetic soles of boots. The walker units did look astonishingly similar to the old corpse-jackets the criminal syndicates used to turn humans into anonymous assassins, while holding their bodies hostage. He floated barely visible in the helmet, bulbous, tendrils snaking down into the water-filled suit. \n“Why are you doing this?” TreLa4 asked, still in her human form.\n“When I see someone who is curious, in the way you are curious about humanity, I want to feed off of it. You aren't the only one who feels a lack of focus.”\nTreLa4 had always thought of the eco-suit as one of the actors, but he had actually joined the troupe of aliens after they had landed in the hub. She had looked for them in the port-tier, after they had the argument, and the proprietor of the trendy comedy club where she had gone so many nights told her that they were gone, left on a long trek to the surface of the mega-planet, possibly in different directions. TreLa4 felt a pang of loss, similar to the pang she feels as an ice-ape when Or2o is lost, she thinks, when the flying grove crashes into the sea. Or when, in the bridge story, she waits for him to return after he disappears down into the clouds on a rope. It is a serious enough emotion to propel her to follow them to the end of the novel, to the city of End, and to pull the Inhabitant (let's call him that, for now) along in her wake. \n“Did you even have humans on your world?” TreLa4 asked. She knew, technically, whatever biome the suit's soup was based on, it wasn't actually the jellyfish's home world, any more than Earth was TreLa4's. If the original ecosystems hadn't gone entirely extinct, the DNA streams wouldn't be in the Continuity's public databases for them to pilfer. \n“There were humanoids, maybe, but not humans,” the suit answered, telepathically. “We had microbial species, related to these...” (he touched a finger to a part of the suit, near the ribs, and it turned translucent, showing a magnified holographic image of scribbled proteins) “...that were qutie close to the fungal symbiots, or zombies, that came after humans, but before...” The inhabitant knocked his gloved finger against his faceplate, indicating in one gesture the fate of the human species after they were exiled from Earth. \nThey had already made up the decision to go, but were delaying the departure, testing themselves and each other, waiting for one of them to back out or disappear. For several months, they had been meeting every few days to walk along the gravity bridges, or turn into birds and tour the forests in some of the catch-basins and surrounding parks. They were surrounded by sentient species, but very few of them had the right mutations to pick up the telepathic images TreLa4 and the Inhabitant shared. They felt safe, and the discussion often turned political.\n“The starship is doing the same thing that those who controlled the floating groves did on almost all of the dimensions in the archive—just at another scale!” TreLa4 thought to him. “The linguists in the ice ape dimension, the nobility, the industrialists, the corporatists, the colonies...”\nThe thoughts of the suit became uncomfortable, like a squid shooting ink. “Don't confuse the archive with the way those dimensions were before we passed them in hyperspace. The way those histories are presented, in hexagonal clusters, may be more of an artifact of the library, imposing its own structure on the data...” \nThe history of species, of worlds, always ended with the moment when the permanent drift-gates were established. The reason, TreLa4 suspected, was that the Star-ship wanted to glorify its own beneficent role, hence the traditional dual ending: one of the characters ending up on the Continuity, sailing off into the rim of the galaxy, and one of the characters deciding to stay behind on their native dimensional cluster, to follow a different kind of continuity, one where the linked worlds lived with the consequences of their sudden proximity.\n“Maybe,” TreLa4 thought, “the choice offered in the Drift stories the actors were performing corresponds with the only real choice for political action—to chose a dimension, and move there, abandoning the starship.” It was a common political theory, that if enough people withdrew from the Biopolis then the trans-planar planetoid would die. The super-sentients, however, warned that the damage caused by the Starship, dead and unpiloted, would be far worse than the sometimes destructive and regrettable distortion effects the megaplanet currently caused. \nThe starship fed off energy released through ruptures in the Drift. Inhabitants of the various worlds along the continuity stream all tended to think that they, themselves were responsible for causing the gates and transpositions to appear. The starship was no different. It is not my home dimension, and I have no special fondness for it, so, in defiance of the censors, and anonymously, I will say the following: \nThe ship itself may be the parasite, the follower and not forger of a path. \nSometime the human and the jellyfish would go back to the club where they had seen the actors perform, and talk about the last time they had seen them.\nThe actors had gotten into an argument, shifting in and out of character. The plot was becoming too complex, exceeding the threshold where the elements could be brought back together into a cohesive whole. The sauroid kept forgetting which part he was playing, and the beeltleish cyborg on his back kept changing the stage-set in the middle of a scene. The six armed cylcops and the woman with two mouths were arguing about who was really in love with who in the fourth act, and whether or not it made any sense to have the two pseudo-ghosts switch bodies permanently when the Continuity II went through the compass-gate. The handsome alien stormed off (he had been playing Lord Motiv), and the space-suit riding cephalapod came towards her, asking if she wanted to grab a drink. \n“I've seen you in the continuity games before. Are you really from the Lambent Drift?” They had decided to walk to one of the outer gravity rings, a cave-like restaurant with a stellarium ceiling. The table had several plants growing out of it, with edible pods and leaves. As she took bites of it, the meal would grow according to her tastes.\n“No, I was on the Continuity when their ship arrived. I saw you in Ifva,” the telepathic jelly-fish thought, “With Zoas. I got that message when you said the actors had arrived. When I heard they were doing a scene about the pseudoghosts, I started going by their rehearsals. They asked me if I wanted the part.” The space-suit reached up and twisted its helmet, the vents sending the dust motes outward in a ripple. She half-expected to see some decayed human skull, but instead it was just the translucent strands of the aquatic floating alien. Using one of the arms of the suit, it sat the helmet upside down on the table, filling it with a greenish liquid from a tall carafe. \n“Tell me about your character,” the human asked the suit, the telepathic jellyfish acting as ambassador for the miniature ecosystem sloshing on the hollow insides.\n“Based off of a form from one of the ancient continuities, who migrated on-board and became a kind of itinerant bard. Like Zoas.”\nTreLa4, curious about their plot algorithms, already knew a lot about the sentient matter the actors had brought on board in lieu of stasis gear. The Lambent Rift had carried archives from several worlds, along with disembodied docents built into the navigation system itself. Their ship was named after the pseudo-ghost's character, an obscure folk-hero in some quarters of the ship. \n“When was he from? Before the Starship pulled him out his time-dimension” TreLa4 asked.\n“The post-human age of Earth, when cybernetics was giving way to indifferentiated biological sentience, and technological cultures were exiled to extra-terrestrial colonies.”\n“Are you really part ghost?” She had asked. The cephalapod nodded, sending a slow wave down its dangling threads. The suit's arms had put the tube from its back into the helmet-bowl, and green bars of liquid, punctuated with air bubbles, followed the negative air pressure up.\nTreLa4, human, naked, stared at the suit-riding jellyfish who knew more about the species she had adopted as her own than she could ever learn, even if the Inhabitant gave her the literacy augment that he had promised. Travel to the surface was dangerous—it was one of the greatest challenges that the starship offered. Even if they survived, they would not finish the journey the same as when they started. They would have to adapt their bodies and minds to allow passage through alien biomes and architectures, translating their innermost experiences into bizarre chemical tongues. \nSome of those who could afford it spent Karma to incarnate as scaled-up versions of registered species, to be able to cover distance more easily as city-sized quadrapeds or vast, carpeted sea-turtles flying in the apergenetic currents. TreLa4 and the Inhabitant couldn't afford such luxuries, but their travel was made more perilous by those who could, and would care nothing for squashing them underfoot. \nGiving in to practicality, TreLa4 abandoned her human form for a flock of winged goats, but the mind that they shared between them kept the neural signatures of her last few incarnations, so she was still human when she dreamed. The space-suit, too, as they jumped and flew up along the ledges of the hub, told her stories that reminded her of Earth, the planets she had never seen.\nCHAPTER SEVEN: SENTIENT EARTH \nInformation began to drift between worlds. Mystics, telepaths, comic book artists, all had been writing about dreams and doubled memories, when their consciousness would be switched with someone like them from another continuity.10 The drift saturated the ligaments between realities. The ice-ape Linguists, the railroad barons, the courtiers and schemers of the Sun King's court, the Peruvian ecologists facing global ecological collapse, the cyborg scientists of the bloodless war, they were all trying to figure out a way to move not just thoughts, but matter between dimensions. They saw, or thought they saw, what was bound to come when that happened: a new era of trade, and new opportunities for exploration, learning, exchange, or conquest.\nTo the Sentient Earth, it seemed like another version of the stasis ghosts, their past rising up to haunt them. Clouds of drift-smog and the choking smell of refineries, the obliteration of all be the smallest patches of the biosphere, in the insane belief that everything could be recreated from jars and plastics. To the Sentients, human ages merged into an indistinguishable destiny of fore-brain laden primates, descendents of the ice apes: death, explosions, the translation of living message into wasteland heavy noise. Visions of one period, as the expansion was just moving beyond the industrial to the petro-chemical, and hegemonic forms of social organization were spreading, as they always had, from centers of surplus wealth and power. \nIn the 19th century with its air-born railway lines and elevated empires and aristocracies, poetry began appearing about the thoughts of animals, trees, and the earth itself. Historically, this was already a tipping point, where urbanized and displaced populations were beginning to express biophiliac sentiments, and environmental awareness was beginning to open (in print) some of its many-lidded eyes. 11\nGovernments of nation-states and cabals of capital, along with ordinary humans who had dreams of an Earth without them, had a right to be afraid of what seemed to be their future. Fear fit well with their theological notions of a sublime and indifferent nature, eternally poised to destroy them.\n\nEfforts were made across the globe, wherever technocracies had power over mass information, to stifle the contagion of alternate-world accounts. Already, plans were being laid in secret to exploit physical gates when they began to appear, while publicly denying their existence. \nWhich side would you be on? Those trying to make the new, inter-dimensional universe possible, or those who wanted their world to remain inviolate? Do you think that the Earth you inhabit would be enriched or lessened by this possibility of cognitive transfer? What about physical, biological? From the point of view of the dimension making contact, it seems like an expanding of horizons, an influx of wonderful new possibilities. On the other hand, the Shift represents natural selection raised to a new level: not just within planets, but between them. As ecological history had shown, the expansion of range for a given living or memetic species could have disastrous results. Inter-globalization might create a less diverse, more hegemonic multi-verse. \nIn the same way, print literature when it first appeared seemed to bring brave new vistas of literate exchange of ideas, an increase in the amount of stories for the back-water towns and remote villages, like those Roger Malwise visited as a bookseller. From the point of view of an overall ecology of narrative, though, the technology of the printing press did what all human technologies did: took a complex, unknowable system and reduced it to one that could be measured and preserved. It represented not a growth of literature but its homogeneity, a kind of marching music drowning out a billion wayward tunes. \n\nPregancy\nArgument: Yillah makes a deal with Motiv to carry his clone, as a fetus, to Earth. \n\nIt was autumn on Earth, in Biopolis, two years later. He was watching Yillah, framed in an open window. Her child (a clone of the inter-planetary mob-boss, genetics tweaked to grow at four times the usual speed) was playing outside. Lambent was explaining to her why he had to leave, to return to the Guild-clave.\n“You won’t come back,” she said. “Once you are in your own body again. Your old life, whatever it is, whoever you are, has nothing to do with us.”\nShe was wrong. He had been in love with her before he joined the Guild. The window behind her kept blasting his sensors with the impossible radiance of the sun settling onto the pillars of ancient trees, the sine waves of mountains, and before he knew it he had spoke. \nBreaker had rented out regions of his hippocampus, pineal gland and neo-cortex to ad agencies, payment up front (minus the cost of surgery). For years, on the ship, they couldn’t tell if it was him speaking, or the neural mal-ware spitting off context-appropriate product placements. Mostly just for things like drift-feul and cosmetic gene augments, but the cheerful jingles sometimes carried hidden tones of jingoism and empire, the acrid suds of involuntary brainwash.\nBy then, though, the Sentients had patched him up, and he walked around the ancient forest game-trails in a daze, trying to pick up the pieces of an unsponsored cognition, unsolicited thoughts. His former self was visible only through a thick and alien atmosphere, a life of illegality and doubt.\nBreaker’s memories had become tangled up with those copyrighted catch-phrases, and the pirate unwiring of those parasitic threads, however subtle, had left him mute and hollow. Lambent's problem, the deal he had made in exchange for two years of anonymity and protection, would be even harder to fix.\n\n~GUILD CONTRACT\n\n“I want my body back,” the voice within the helmet said. \nHe was sitting in the floating city at the center of the moon, one of the hubs of the pseudo-ghosts. Returning to the city the sense of vertigo was greater than it had been in the zero-gravity orbital stations. There were so many suits, identical to his, with slightly different dents or models. The vertical arches, columns, and shadows observed the importance of the interview with the minor criminal bureaucrat. Everywhere was the deep purple that suffused the caverns.\nThis ugly violet was lighting a lot of egg-like furniture, modular cubicles, and a crowd of off-planet undesirables making regrettable decisions. The glow was uniform, and indirect, with fuzzy smears of shading. “You need to speak with Mr. Sehir,” the syndicate secretary said, motioning Lambent to another identical chamber. \nMr. Sehir explained the problem, sending to the display the recorded cortical feed of the scene with Yillah, the woman Lambent had been in hiding with for the past two years on Earth. He replayed the audio where he whispered who he was. Not his name, but it might have been enough for someone to track them. \n“But how could the other space-man have gotten this?” Lambent asked. Mr. Sehir stared, waiting for the smuggler to figure it out. “Dreams,” Lambent said. “Psychic drift.” He had been having flashes of them himself, the man whose body was inside his suit, the biological brain playing host to his parasitic hijacking, would sometimes send signals in the form of memories and visions, interfering with the algorithms of his own consciousness, beamed at an incredible distance.\n“So you probably know as much about Sunjac as I do.” It was strange, the first time, to have the name spoken out loud. Sehir glanced around the vaulted chamber, as if looking for more information about the contract man behind the huge, ornamental vases. Their surface had been painted, seemingly by hand, in the style of the low-gravity iconography, the bands of dense, interwoven symbols. “You know that he had stolen from Motiv, and that he is planning on using you, and the information you have about his runaway carrier and infant clone, as a bargaining chip to regain his favor.” \n“How?” Lambent asked, unable to see how Sunjac, the violent criminal whose dreams he'd been inhabiting, could use the situation to his advantage. No matter what he did, he couldn't thaw out Lambent without breaking the transfer, in which case Sunjac's body would...\n“By becoming sentient. It's happened before. The suit is patched with xenian biotech, enough to hold the signal, and the original body is irrelevant.”\n“Okay,” Lambent said, not liking the sensation of figuring out what Sehir already knew, “so Sunjac takes of the suit, and my body thaws out. Motiv then has me for torture, and this body just...”\n“Dies. While SunJac lives as a cyborg, or a full sentient.” Sehir was staring at him knowingly, and Lambent remembered what it was like walking on Earth, feeling the vines of a living, telepathic biosphere wrapping itself around his brainstem, whispering secrets of immortality.\n\nGenre, based on Mars, was the powerful and corrupt interplanetary army of human accountants that had hired Yillah to carry the cloned baby to the mob boss on Earth. It was one of the few remaining human enterprises on Mars of any significance. In the loose web of non and sub-sentient alliances governing the solar system, Genre and the Guild were major players on opposite sides. Both idealized pre-Slowdown genetics, although concessions on both colonies were made to the realities of off-world existence, humans on Mars preferring gene-hacks (splicing their DNA with either Martian or Xenian code), and the Lunars largely relying on advanced cybernetics. By running away from the Moon to Mars, the generic agent had given up any chance of returning to his own body. He also doomed the owner of whatever half-corpse he was controlling to never returning to theirs. \n~FOG SCROLL \nThere was a political cartoon about the Guild featuring the typical space man/woman, with the distributor pumps concealed in a diamond-shaped flourishes, the boxwork in back exaggeratedly large. Lambent had laughed at it growing up. The jokes mostly revolved around identity mix-ups because of their indistinguishable appearance. Romantic mishaps occurred, which always carried morbid undercurrents, since their bodies were frozen inside the suits. In one of the comics the space-person had taken off their helmet only to reveal a smaller helmet underneath. In another, the seal snapped in a puff of vapor, to reveal inside a floating snail. \nTo be honest, a lot of what I do (as a narrative algorithm) is just translate into into text from comic books I find from other dimensions online—in the clouds, as they used to say even in the days before the sentient swarms. \nThe ridiculousness of his situation, sitting with the space-woman, who might or might not have been the one who had interviewed him before he had signed the contract, did not escape him. Sitting across the preternatural polish of the slab of crystalline polymer, they both, without having faces, could read one another's resonance scans as clearly as if they were telepathic ice apes. The basic plot was this: he couldn't take off his helmet without Sunjac, the criminal assassin, regaining consciousness. The Guild, including the representative sitting across from him, had intimated that if he were to thaw, the Guild would at least be able to question Sunjac, and Lambent might have some time before Motiv realized the switch had been made. \nAs he went over the records of the other pseudoghosts, feeds as well as resonance imaging, he couldn't entirely suppress his revulsion, and regretted joining the Guild. At the same time, this was what he was paying for. The worse the crimes of the other cybernetically-suited corpses, the more protection their individual identities had. Everyone shared a mutual stake in maintaining the plausible deniability the consciousness transfers conferred. \n“There is a way,” the other space-suit said, her head surrounded in a halo of information, “for you to legally unlock the suit.” Mr. Sehir had undoubtedly known about the loophole, but sent one of his agents so the leak couldn't be traced back to his office. \nThey spent the next two weeks in the library on Nuna (a contraction of New-Luna), looking through the old-earth codices and incunabula kept in the drilled mnemonic wells. The effect of a telepathic consciousness being sent through the qauntum relay of the suit, was to establish low level machine-language flashes between other nearby pseudo-ghosts. It was probably the reason that Sunjac had figured out whose body he was controlling. \nOf course he would know that everything he had done, seen, and heard, would end up in the Guild's records. They would know about the augments Zoa had given him on Earth. They would know what he was contemplating now. Sehir knew his identity, and the only thing preventing the Guild from blackmailing him was their reputation. \nThe other space suit could also read, which was a considerable oddity. She had paid credits for the Yazisiz cure, and knew which of the Lunar trenches would have what they were looking for. It was part of an antiquated law that all legislation had to be stored in paper form—in addition to the millions of books shipped up to Earth, the Sentients selling the history of humanity back to them along with the genetic capacity to make sense of it, there were also physical copies, in scrolls of plant-fibre marked with ink, copies of all obscure and binding legislation since the exile.\nThe Caverns of the Aitke Basin12 could store the paper in a vacuum, preventing the oxidization and slow burning that would have eventually occurred on Earth. The anonymous woman in the suit found the statute that would allow him to thaw himself, and be released from the penalties of his contract. This would only do him any good, of course, if he survived.\n~Motiv\n\nWhile Lambent was petitioning the Guild for the release of his body, and trying to find a way out of his contract, Yillah had left Earth to confront Lord Motiv, the cloned super-human whose offspring she had accidentally brought to term. He lived on an enormous flying yacht that traveled between the domed colonies of Earth, in defiance of Sentient and Genre law. Lambent had warned her not to go. \nThe dirigible was as gaudy as it was massive, with kitch nostalgic architecture of Mars. Motiv's evil, too, seemed to be anachronistic, a throwback to the opulent days of barbarity before the data-clouds. Even for a human, he was remarkable. The ribbed encrusions of the ship even looked, vaguely, like bones and an elongated skull. Robots swarmed across the surface, tending the elaborate gardens. Any one of them could be flipped into the mode of soldier, their implements put to deadlier purpose. The forest below them was covered in snow, hued with solstice. In the distance the planet-engines were churning out plumes of atmosphere. \nHe was the kind of human that, rather than accepting exile gracefully, expended millions of hours of labor in maintaining the trappings of a culture as extinct, despite propaganda to the contrary, as biological humans themselves. The only reason humans existed at all was because they had been preserved by the marcabre technology of the Postponement. Natural selection had been held at bay by a kind of unnatural occult, according to the Sentients, and a naturally evolved Earth was, for them, one free of the apocalyptically destructive force known as humanity. \nYillah had been born in one of the brief arterial-pumps of technophilic civilization, when a previous age's implements were used in an attempt to reach thresholds built into the cybernetics keeping generations of humanity asleep. The most vivid memory of her childhood was green mountains. Not mountains covered in trees, or mountains covered in plants, or anything alive. The surface, unnaturally smooth and sculpted, was painted a lush veridian the exact color of chlorophyll. In a lab somewhere chimpanzee brains had been prodded to determine the exact hue evocative of a healthy ecosystem, and in an attempt at making their few unghosted citizen's feel secure, they sprayed toxic colorants across the wasteland. \nYillah stared out of her unbruised eye at the minor lord, his yellow cape flapping dramatically against the wind. Even knowing what he had done, his preternatural attractiveness constantly sent messages to her brain stem (trust him, he knows what he is doing). She had watched the robot guards throw three men over-board. Their bodies had been bouyed by the ship's anti-gravity for a moment, bobbing in a slowed descent, their screams dopplering. She was next. There hadn't been any questions put to them prior to their being tossed. Motiv, though, had stared at them intently, looking down through the cleft in his enormous jaw, below the perfect contours of his nose. His nostril-hairs, she saw, had been carefully trained to spiral in opposite directions.\nBelow them, the sound of birds. Then complete silence. She had been about to turn her hips, to bend her lips to speaking, but it was as if she had suddenly been cast into a block of lunar ice. Time-freeze. That explained the look of terror in the captive's eyes before the cyborgs heaved them into the sky. With Earth gravity, the fall would take only minutes, but if Motiv had a way to amp up synaptic speed, then subjectively they might have months or years to contemplate their immanent deaths. \n“How old would he be by now?” Motiv asked her without moving his lips. “My clone. I remember ordering him for next summer.” If they hadn't been this far above the muted red clouds, it might have been snowing. She was shivering uncontrollably, wearing only the tight-fitting under-suit she had on when they took her armor. The lord, she saw, delighted in her fear and embarrassment.\nAt once, she put things together, linking what she was now experiencing with what she already knew. Genre executives and been giving themselves gene-treatments for telepathy, splicing in codons from Sentients. Motiv wanted the genetic clone so he could have memories of his own death. That was why he needed Lambent.\nIt was more than being able to speak directly into someone else's mind, or send them images. Motiv had been using quantum relays, similar to how the pseudo-ghosts controlled connected space-suits, in order to live the experience of falling to pulverized death from his yacht, again and again. She hadn't put all that together herself, she realized from the noble's grin. He had just told her.\n\n~Breaker\n\nBreaker, who had been the mechanic on the Continuity, was walking along the bridges and hanging structures of the shadow-nests on the raider's hide-out. He had been unconscious for the first week on Earth, and was convinced that they had died, Lambent having piloted the cargo ship too close to the planet. Any normal ship would have been destroyed, but Zoa had piloted the ship safely by telepathy. Breaker had woken up with the ad-ware removed from his hippocampus, and Yillah had woken up with the cloned baby of a Genre mob boss. \nThe entire ecosystem was sentient, or at least a small number of each animal species. Every molecule in the biosphere was poisonous—Breaker couldn't go outside of Continuity without a mask, and had to suck his food through a treatment tube. He had to make a decision, and so had gone for a walk. Mildly telepathic insects trailed him, landing and crawling on the ropes. He had also been joined by a native creature halfway between a goat and a bird, with hooves for stability on the cliffs, and wings to break long falls. They were flightless, only capable of glides, but very sure-footed.\nLambent, having just taken off from the moon, had been furious when Breaker told him, over relay, about Yillah leaving to confront the Generic crime lord. “We're going after her,” he had said, escaping the atmosphere of the moon and the fear he felt, the claustrophobia of gravity. Breaker had asked the space-man how he intended to find her, and Lambent had told him about the renegade suit, how he couldn't get his own body back until he had found it. He told Breaker how the runaway was almost certainly tied to Yillah and Ruo, the clone. If they could get to the suit that had bolted from the Guild contract, then they could get to Motiv and Yillah. \nThere was a shadow on the planks, and then the fully grown six-year old dropped down, standing on the back of a pteredactyl-thing, holding gently onto two long whisker-feathers. “My mother is in trouble,” he said. “I know,” Breaker said. “I'm going to leave on Albedo tonight.” \nRuo said he was going, too, and the mechanic shook his head, telling him it was too dangerous.\n“I was just flying on the back of a dinosaur,” the boy pointed out. “In order for the mental transfer to work, my genetic code had to match my father's, or brother's, exactly.” \n“That's exactly why you have to stay here. You shift back to our Earth and the moment you're scanned they are going to call in the Registry.” \nFor 60,000 years, modifying the human genome was the highest criminal offense, after taking human life in war. Cloning was still illegal, as well as certain black-market splices or Sentient-controlled augmentations, but modifying DNA for longevity, beauty, and health had been the norm for several thousand. Telepathy was the real taboo, which was why running with a Guild suit was dangerous. As a rare example of “pure” human genetics, with an unaltered lineage going back to the pre-molecular age, Breaker was afforded certain protections as an endangered species. If he were to allow the Albedian raiders to give him a chance against Lord Motiv and his robot army, he would have to give up on his certification, and live the rest of his life as just another anonymous augment. \nThe weakness, stereotypes, and history of his humanity had been an integral part of Breaker's identity since he had been called a fossil in the nursery. The dubious privilege of authentic genetics was the only compensation his family had for hundreds of generations, as they aged, died, and suffered from innumerable ailments simple gene-treatments could have fixed. Their small, persistent subculture had been like the Scholars in the great slow-down, those who prided themselves in never having skipped over eras through cryogenics. His entire life humanity had been a mask he was forced to wear. Every species he ever met thought they knew everything about him because they had seen a human once on stage. They would lower their voices to a level where condescension and envy overlapped, and say “I mean you're a real human. One with instincts.” They expected violence, crudeness, the clumsy walk of space-suits. This was the decision he had to make: would he stay human, safe in his own and other's expectations, or would he allow the sentient planetoid to turn him into something else, capable of dealing with the danger they were in?\nRuo had been talking, telepathically, with the whiskered pterodactyl, who had settled on a bridge-post, while a river of mist wound through the ravine. Another ancestral skill he would aquire with the illicit with gene-treatments. “They say that you would always be welcome here. They would create a place for you in the pantheon, and for the descendents of your thoughts.” The number of Sentients on Earth was determined by the number of species. For every animal with a brain stem, a small number of consciousnesses inhabited that spot in the planetary matrix. They could leap from donkey-bird to donkey-bird, for example, but couldn't be in two places at once. All the rest of the planetary life was non-conscious, but susceptible to some degree of telepathic control by their sentient representative in the council, or pantheon of spirits. \n“Even if we die,” Ruo said, scratching the donkey behind its wings, “the planet will remember us, and can put us in cliff-rats until we can find some clones. All you have to do is let this planet change you.”\nBreaker had learned a lot from the aliens, even without the telepathic cortical augments Lambent (there was no doubt, now, that the suit was the hover-car driver). They had showed him the layers of human relics, the buried techno-coated catacombs. Lambent had explained it to him, how the entire human race had been wiped out by the zombie virus, and were only later reconstructed by Sentients curious about their own past. The post-humans brought them back from fossilized DNA in the same way that 22nd century humans had brought back telepathic ice apes. Maybe he was allowing his genetic code to be his script,with his role written in advance. \nWhat was so special about expansion-age humanity? Why should he live his life as a walking memorial to the past, in genetics like a book that had been read too many times?\n“Fine,” he said, looking at the gargoyle-like sentient balanced on the bridge. “Do it.” \nHe took off his mask, coughing, leaning against the donkey.\n\n~Switch\nLambent spent one last day on the lunar surface, racing hover-cycles. The tracks weren't anything like those on Mars, although Breaker would have been impressed by some of the remote micro-tracks around the craters on the far side, where without the looming scepter of the Earth Lambent could almost think he was back on Mars, or maybe Deimos. \nHe didn't know, then, because the Guild was filtering all of his communication, that Yillah had left the alien archeologist encampment and gone to see Lord Motiv in the hopes of settling her debt. The guild, finally, the day it looked like she would be murdered, told the young hover-racer, knowing that he would agree to the thaw, if it meant a chance to save her life. \nHe met the other suit in the Guild enclave, surrounded by armed guards, and they keyed in the sequence. \n\n~SunJac\nSunjak had been on Motiv's urboreal islands, a kind of archipelago and air-yacht, watching the crime lord toss captives over the side. There was something personal in his pursuit of Yillah and Lambent; enough for the reward for the information he had given the family to outweigh the cost of his earlier betrayal, when he'd fled to the moon to escape his debts. \nMotiv had promised to make Sunjak immortal. Sentient strings of protein sequence were carefully regulated both by humans and their descendents. The intermediate step, zombie telepaths, existed in a few wandering herds on Earth, Deimos and the Martian sky-shelves. \nNow he was here, back on Nuna, and he could feel his body thawing in its suit. He felt like a mummy waking up, ready to curse those standing near its tomb. \n“Who are you?” Sunjak asked, checking his biometrics and readouts. \n“You know better than to ask that,” the space-suit said. \nSunjak killed her. The suit had built up enough solar kinetics for him to move with super-human speed, and Genre's cognitive side-loading had made him more than capable of taking out a standard-model walker. \nThen he tried to get off planet. Lambent's information and data-tags were still in the helmet, but it was looking for a signal from outside, not within the suit itself. He found Albedo, and she responded to his thoughts. Before he had escaped the gravity well, just as Earth had risen over the bone-colored horizon, the Guild's ships had surrounded him, a huge flagship looming like a whale.\n\n~\n\nWith time frozen, just before she got pushed to her death, Yillah saw the spaceman. He had been headed to the lunar enclave, and by now should be back in his own body. Motiv turned, following either her gaze or her thoughts. He made some telepathic indication to the robot delta-wave readers, and they brought the frozen half-ghost forward. \n“Take the helmet off,” the lord said telepathically to the guardener, the thoughts more ancient than the sound of the clone's voice would have been. \n“I'll die,” the pseudo-ghost thought back.\nThe suit that Yillah mistook for Lambent was the runaway that Lambent had been charged with tracking down. He wasn't a prisoner, as Yillah thought; he was one of Motiv's agents. A decade ago the suit on the yacht had run away from the crime lord, and had joined the Guild to survive. Hacking into the ghost's data-cloud at the center of the moon, he had learned about the location of the Lord Motiv's missing clone: enough intelligence to buy his way back into the syndicate's favor. That, and Lambent's dealing with the Sentients, which the Martian humanists would see as a betrayal of the species. \nYillah's hair was whipping in the wind. Motiv leaned closer, menacing her towards the edge. His perspective changed as the space-suit on the flying yacht took a step towards them.\n\n~\nThe crackling field of the drift cannon swept over them, instantly warping the hull's pressure to critical. A moment earlier, Sunjac had armed Albedo's shield. A moment before that, a generic remote mine had detonated. \n\n~\nYillah's heels were off the ship, her fingers trying to help her toes by clawing at the air. \nRecording\n\n\nSehir, high in the Guild's food chain, had no trouble learning about Lambent Rif. Freezing his body and transferring his consciousness into another helmet had ensured the augmented raider anonymity in his deeds to everyone in the solar system. Except him. It was written in the contract. \nWhen Lambent had been caught fencing Earth relics and genetic samples to rebels in crater-walls, traveling under giant umbrella-domes like snails, the Martian government had fined him enough to indenture him for three natural lifespans. He had fled, and the only place to flee to, where the Martians couldn't get to him, was frozen in a space suit. Yillah had been one of his co-conspirators, but she had escaped, and he hadn't given her up. They were lovers, briefly, after the cargo-ship had landed, before the price was put on their heads. \nBreaker Glica was a recently brought back ghost, resurrected under draconian and predatory indenturing clauses, making him unable to alter his genes, even for standard longevity treatments. Lambent was right to help him, but stupid to get caught, since it was the case of the biologist/pilot that led the humanist agents to him. The smuggling charges were a cover for a crime against ideology: questioning the treatment of the ghosts and zombies, reminders of the now irrelevant time when humans ruled the Earth.\nThis was part of the recording Sehir would listen to from his helmet, later, after the body in the suit was officially dead and Lambent's corpse had been tossed into the deep mined trenches of the moon:\nFloating sea-turtles drifted by overhead, along with strange transparent octupii and winged crustaceans. They were species from old Earth, that had gone extinct with the last of the ur-trees. One of them glided down in a slow corkscrew, and settled onto the damp ground in front of me. It had recently rained, the clouds still trailing a dark wet curtain to the East.\nThe tribe of Sentients explained (as we flew through their underground city, filled with bio-luminescent bugs) that...[recording corrupted] \n\n~Escape\nAt the moment Continuity II passed through the charging field of the drift-cannon, Lambent switched minds with the assassin on the boat. It isn't something the Guild likes to talk about, but it happened. The quantum relay got derailed by the weapon, and he wound up in the body of his worst enemy. Yillah was tottering on the edge, miles of air between her and Earth.\nSix years had passed since they had crashed onto the surface of the planet, and she had given birth to Ruo, the crime-lord's clone. This was her decision, the one thing she had control over, that Lambent couldn't keep her from doing: trying to fix what he had broken. When he had taken the Continuity II to the moon, she had taken one of the smaller sentients, manifesting as insects on a piece of rotten wood, who pointed the direction towards Motiv's base by aligning themselves, like the needle of a compass, showing her where to go.\nLambent didn't understand how slowly time was moving. Then he did. The man who his memories told his he was now inhabiting was Motiv's body guard. In return for bringing him information on his clone, his suit (which he would never again be able to take off) had been given telepathic and synaptic upgrades. Motiv had sped up Yillah's mind in order for her to suffer more as she fell, and his own, so he could enjoy it. The assassin was a better fighter than Lambent was. His mind, fresh with the assassin’s memories and skills, was running exponentially faster than normal.\nThe sky ripped apart, and they saw for a moment the landscape below them shift. It was night, human fires built in mimicry of the stars. Then it was gone. The snowy landscape returned. \nLambent felt the deck of the air-ship start to buck passing over a patch of thicker atmosphere, and used it to spring forward as Yillah and the evil lord fell back, kicking Motiv in the side of the head. The bloodless-age robots opened fire, lasers burning charred holes through the space-suit and whoever's frozen body was inside. Yillah was rolling on the deck. Using telepathic codes Motiv had given the suit, Lambent ordered the cyborgs to turn their guns on one-another. Half of them did. Then Motiv stuck a sword through his head. The suit, though, was being controlled through relay by whatever cryogenic unit he was in, so as long as there was enough synaptic density and mechanical integrity in the connected armor plates, the body would continue to function. \nYillah shot Motiv in the back. One of the things flashing through the psychic bleed of the identity transfer was that Motiv had been wearing a belt to keep him on the ship—it was why I hadn't acted on my first plan, which was knocking him over-board. I used it now though, grabbing a handful of the bright yellow cape in one arm and Yillah in the other, and jumping over board. The belt caught in the magnetic field, as I had hoped, and the cape held, choking the last bit of life out of the Generic villain. \nThe surviving prisoners had joined the robot mutiny, grabbing lasers from the disabled guardians. While controlling several cyborgs remotely, Lambent led Yillah's hand to a loop on his suit. Then rising hand over hand along the cape, empty winter sky of Mars below them, he pulled up to Motiv's corpse and started firing at the last remaining robots, Yillah out of range below, until his arm got blown off. Then he held onto Yillah, and waited.\nBelow them, the tops of six titan Guild cruisers broke through the clouds. “Genre warships will be arriving soon,” the voice of Mr. Sehir called through the splintered helmet. “We need to go.” \nThis is where that comic book page comes from, the smoking and battered planks of the pleasure-ship, under the sail-shadows, obscured by the uneven atmosphere. Motiv's rapier through the helmet and the skull underneath, which Yillah has recognized as Lambent's Pools of half-frozen blood. The huge hulls of the Guild ships rising across the edges of the page.\n~Rescue\nAfter his brain died, Lambent's mind, still inhabiting the suit-pack of the other Guild member, blinked again into the cybernetic body that had just escaped the moon. The ship's shields had been destroyed, the cock-pit cracked, and only the helmet-bowl itself between the zero of vacuum and the luke-warm brain whose grey matter he was haunting. It was his brain, but the suit was still looking to the other unit for commands. The defector and Lambent had been in each other's suits the entire time: it was why the Council had chosen me to try and hunt him down. \nGeneric cyborgs locked onto and lassoed the wreckage of Continuity II into an airlock. They must have heard that Motiv was dead, and that the Guild was invading their stronghold on Earth. When the flagship got word that one of Motiv's clones had returned, they went back to Earth, and Lambent was transferred into a larger prison. The new clone was supposed to have a bodyguard more powerful than any of the genetic soldiers the super-powers could produce. Yillah must have been taken by the Guild. \nAfter a few days, a cyborg came and told him he had an audience with the Lord. The man in a bright yellow cape was about half the age of the one who had tried to murder Yillah. Standing next to him was Breaker, twice as tall as he had been before, and with three rows of vicious looking spikes running down his back and shoulders.\n“Lambent?” The clone asked. “It's me. Ruo.”\nThat's how they took control over the second largest criminal syndicate in the system. The largest, the Guild, wanted the suit he was wearing back, and they were holding Yillah hostage. Without the cryo-unit, the body inside would regain consciousness, and he would cease to exist. Motiv's old assassin, who had run away with my body (now completely dead) would wake up. \n“We're sorry,” Mr. Sehir had told him. “That's the policy. The spacesuit and anything inside of it is ours.” You have four days or the woman will be killed.\nWhat was left to do, but stage a daring rescue?\n\n~Rewrite\n“So the way that Aza and the other Sentients saved Lambent's life as the suit started to wear out is they combined them with a literary algorithm. His consciousness was reduced to prose, but the equivalent of a trillion pages a second.” The liquid in his helmet was almost gone. The back-pack's lining of lights had gone from red to blue.\n“Promise me something,” TreLa4 said, wiping her teeth. “The whole play isn't going to turn out to be some kind of computer game, right? Some fantasy of a literary algorithm gone mad in space? With all the events happening in one character's imagination.” \n“No,” the jelly-fish answered. “Humans, despite everything that had happened in their past, always expected the future to confirm their own cosmic importance.” He gestured with his skirt of tentacles. “A starship? I've been here as long as you; I know most of the minds trapped in the games think they are on an asteroid programmed for some predestined paradise.” \nThe suit leaned closer, the head of the aquatic alien looking as if it would tip over the edge like an egg yolk from its shell. “Here's where I think we are: Earth. An asteroid, flying through space. The planet still exists—we don't. We are the memories of whatever happened next.” The space-suit leaned back, and tipped the helmet onto his shoulders, snapping the lock. \n\n~Recap\nThe same patterns kept repeating themselves at larger scales. The same lesson had to be learned again and again: you weren't the center of anything. Children learned there were other people. Cities learned there were other tribes. Tribes built boats, and discovered other continents. Finally, the planet learned of other Earths. \nDimensional travel makes things complicated. If you prefer, think of the whole novel as what might have been sung by prognositicating ice-apes, speculating on what would happen if they broke the law, and wrote things down. The power of the past would grow until the present was ruled by ghosts and cyborgs. \nWhile in jail on Motiv's base, waiting for an audience with the new Lord, Lambent went over in his mind what had happened since he had his body frozen with the Guild. \nThe monetary policy on Mars was based entirely on gene-credits. The symbolic cost translated, not into paying for the medical procedure, which was standard and cheap, but on the license for the sequence. The two criminal organizations, Genre and the Guild, held most of the patents on the human species and pre-zombie variants. Ice ape genetics, or anything else granting direct telepathy, was outlawed.\nThe better sequences available were under patent, and licensed for only a lifetime. Children would have to buy their genes like their parents had. It was illegal to pass them on. As a predictable crop of jar-heads from the slowdown were resurrected, their sequences were snatched up by whatever corporation was responsible for their reintroduction. \n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: CYBORG ZOMBIES II\n\nAn old man was sitting on the edge of the reflecting pool, joined at the ankles with his inverse twin in the moon-filled water. The simulation they were in had replaced the Mongolian wasteland with incredibly lush trees, climbing over one another in a vine-strangled riot to reach the sun. The sky's shade was a cerulean not seen in the real world for a thousand years. As Nazkio stepped forward, the old man's gaze climbed slowly up the tank-commander's reflection on the opposite side of the oblong pool, until he was looking up into the scowling face. \n“You must be general So,” Nazkio said. The irregular patches of coloring on the old man's skin indicated extensive gene treatments, and the grafting of cloned tissue. EfSun had described the man and his family in his report, and had handed over the data packet with the encryption key. Several nights in a row, as the crawling tank-city rumbled through the underground tunnels to its next battlefield, he had loaded the game into his private bunk, the one synaptic interface where Global might not trace the signal. \nNazkio had often wondered if the war, long sunless months punctuated by brief episodes of terror, would be possible without the mental analgesic of the games. Not only did they pass the time, but they blunted the sting of real robot-death when the time came. Physically, soldiers were unharmed when their mechs were destroyed, but the neural controls for the machines, especially the bipedal models, worked directly with the reptilian hind-brain. Death, in the games or on the surface, tugged on the strings of human's deepest evolutionary mandate for survival, its darkest understanding of the absence of life. \nSome, because of the ecological conditions covering most of the planet, looked at the present moment in history as a nadir for the species, the last gasp of civilization in a wasteland. Nazkio, though, remembered what it was like on the poles. Their beauty, too, depended entirely upon the remaining populations of Earth not living in them. The only thing capable of convincing humanity to abandon the garden for the plastic-strewn equator-regions, to travel to the parts of the still-living biosphere and try to sew the seeds that could regrow the planet, was war. It was that, or go back to the age of money and propaganda. \nThe old man, despite the wrinkles on his face, as if a loose sack had been pulled over his skull, stood gracefully and walked halfway along the edge toward Nazkio, and stopped. His dark eyes glinted. Nazkio judged the environment to be modeled after pre-industrial Earth, before the ancient oil civilizations collapsed, their floating cities tumbling into ash and rust. “Commander Nazkio. Private EfSun told you about my family?” \n“He tracked down three rogue mechs, and was hit by a pulse cannon. You talked to him, gave him this address.”\n“Yes,” So said. “Then he shot my children.” \nHe didn't sound angry or surprised. “They are keeping you prisoner there? Your family.”\nThe wrinkled head, bald except for a few white hairs, nodded. \n“As a soldier,” Nazkio said carefully, “he did exactly what he should have.”\n“What about you?” So asked. The tank-commander wondered how secure the scientist's toy-world was, and how freely he should speak. \n“The soldier said that your children were protecting him, firing on Union troops. Are you trying to defect?”\n“Yes,” So said, “but not to you.” He turned his back to the tank-commander, who was a head taller and twice again as heavy as the aged scientist. By the time of the ecological collapse, the concept of race had been made nearly obsolete by global migrations. After the collapse, when populations were confined to habitable zones, inbreeding and seclusion had again caused definable characteristics to spring up, although on completely different lines than the racial types of previous eras. Thousands of years of bloodless war against enemies you never saw had given rise to a new crop of racial prejudice, more virulent than at any other time in history, drawn roughly along the lines of Global and Union enclaves. Conspiracy theories suggested that one of the reasons both sides were so against gene-treatments is that if humans could choose their race (or their appearance of race, since in reality the category was imaginary), this time-tested foundation of the endless conflict would crumble.\nWith a burst of speed, So's upper half spun around, followed by his hips, landing the side of his foot on Nazkio's jawbone, which exploded in pain. The force of the cyclone kick threw him into the brackish water of the pool. Sputtering, he went from anger to wanting to laugh. So was unmoving, as if nothing had happened. Nazkio paddled backward to the other side of the pool, keeping his eyes on the old man as he climbed onto the hard stones. The stars shimmered above them. “What are you doing?”\n“It's something I've taught my children, to keep the cannon's monitoring algorithms from picking up anything suspicious from our brain scans.” Extrapolating someone's exact thoughts from magnetic resonances in the skull was impossible, but different areas of the brain lit up when basic emotions were triggered, or if there was suspicious amount of electricity in the regions responsible for abstract reasoning. Treason, the secret services had found, had a particular neural signature. “Fighting, we're just in another training simulation. Besides, I find it helps to focus thoughts.” Placing one foot carefully and leaning back, the old scientist jumped across the water, landing a storm of blows on Nazkio's face and chest before his feet touched the ground. \nNazkio was a large man, well-muscled, and spent hours every day honing his skills in hand-to-hand combat. He blocked a kick and grabbed one of the scientist's thin ankles and attempted a sweep of the other leg, but So jumped over the hold, the bridge of his free foot connecting with Nazkio's chin, sending his neck snapping back and knocking him back to the ground. It didn't make sense. Like the ninja-mechs his soldiers had been running up against, it seemed as if Union had found out a way around the transmission delay.\n“What do you know about dimensional travel?” So asked, his breath still slow and even. EfSun was right, Nazkio thought, the old man is crazy.\nNazkio rolled backwards over his shoulders onto his feet, crouching defensively. “A mass delusion,” he said, “shared by soldiers around the world, more so in the last few years. Conveniently, they claim that only information can travel between dimensions, making it impossible to verify their claims. Psychotics with their minds too blasted from shell-shock and chewing drift-seeds to know the difference between reality and hallucination.” \nSo nodded, thoughtfully. He had switched fighting styles, and shuffled towards Nazkio, his arms and elbows tracing awkward undulations. In range, Nazkio cautiously explored his defenses, and pushed when he thought he felt an opening. The scientist used his tiny frame to redirect the force of the blow, and Nazkio was sent stumbling on the uneven stones, nearly falling again into the water. \n“Already,” So said, “individuals have so little control over their lives. Men like EfSun think that he earns his suits of armor, but in reality soldiers only power the suits, not control them. The system is predetermined by its structure, technologies passed on over thousands of years. How much of our own actions are we really responsible for? Even words, thoughts, come from the outside. All we can do is select them, choose how we manage ourselves as a conduit for larger patterns.\nThe old man's dialogic combat reminded him of the games he used to play growing up, when he had to cram for Global's military exams. The underground data-streams had modified war-games where your enemies would pipe in whatever programmed facts you wanted to memorize, locking information into your subconscious through strong mnemonic clues of adrenalin and bloodshed. Re-enactments of ancient battlefields would grow sluggish, like dropped in some viscous liquid, and heroes from both sides would hold forth on some obscure subject of martial regulation or gravitational physics. Only in this case his adversary was spouting the kind of viral memes both Global and Union militaries spent trillions of Yen trying to stomp out. “Why don't you tell me what I'm doing here. Your new black-shelled mechs have been tearing holes in our lines for months. Why did you give the soldier these coordinates in the grid?”\nNear the pool, whose surface reflected the concentrated belt of stars from the galactic disk, was a headless stone statue, a corroded and verdigrised plinth with an unreadable description. Next to the statue were two sharpened sticks. So picked them up, and threw one to Nazkio. Spears, Nazkio thought. The same word they used for the gravity spikes dropped from space, before critically low populations made all killing illegal.\n“This temple was destroyed in the last battle. The forest, of course, disappeared almost as soon as our species learned to plant instead of scavenge.” He attacked first with the blunt end of the spear, twirling it from hand to hand. Nazkio rarely trained with weapons. Mechs simply had whatever blades or extensions they needed grafted onto them; “holding” a spear or gun was as much a part of the past as the rest of the environment. “The Blues and Greens both think that they can use inter-dimensional technology to win the war. Both sides have commanders and technicians whose minds have been swapped with doubles from other worlds. I myself am from a contiguous reality.” The pointed end of So's spear shot downwards across Nazkio's upper arm. It bled. \nThe old man went on. “For five thousand years it has seemed impossible for the war to escalate. Individuals joined tribes, tribes formed cities, cities nations, nations corporations, until all Earth was one one side or the other of two major powers. It won't stop there. This is what they call a verge-world now, when other dimensions are starting to cross. Soon we will enter the Drift. The entire planet will become a game-piece on a battle-field larger than one world can imagine.” Nazkio charged, and the scientist planted his spear and vaulted over the tank-commander's head, landing behind him.\n“For the last time,” Nazkio growled, bleeding, “what do you want?”\nSo stopped, the spear falling to the ground. “I want you to sneak my children off the pulse cannon. In return, I will help you destroy it.” \n~Aza\n\nAza was the oldest. When their father was gone, she was in charge. He wasn't gone, really, sitting with his legs folded in the cell, but he was in the data-clouds, somewhere, and had shut off their connections. He had explained to her, because she was the oldest, what was going to happen, and explained why he wanted then to spend time in their real bodies before it did. \nIllum and Juvien had finished washing the dishes and were growing restless. This was time they usually spent in the games, training, or learning about science and history from the underground knowledge bases. There were three stacked bunks in the hexagonal room, dirty-white walls and one display, showing a window to the desert night. Not an actual window, of course, but the view was real, or what they would have seen through the metal shells. She sat for a while, her legs crossed, trying to imitate her father. Illum and Juvien were escalating their argument into a physical fight, and Aza snapped them into silence. From the battlefields, they were used to following her orders. Her two brothers had spent their entire lives on the cannon, nearly all of it in this cell. She had been on the surface once, when she was four. It was a lot like tele-presence, but with a less interactive landscape, and in the stiff atmosphere suit she had gotten itchy and bored. That was when their father had still looked middle-aged. \n“Why can't we go outside?” Illum asked, meaning connect with the interface. \n“We're going to be leaving soon,” Aza said. “Our father wants us to remember what it's like.”\n“Where are we going?”\n“I don't know.”\n“How long will we be gone?”\n“I don't know. A long time.”\n“Will we be able to play games there?”\n“Yes.” Juvien, the silent middle child, had been watching the exchange, and decided it was the moment to throw an orange peel at his brother's head. Illum responded with a battle cry. Aza let them roll around on the floor for a while, and then pulled them apart. \n“When are we going to get our droids back?” Juvien said, returning to his sulk. He had been the most upset at the loss of the new robots, and had vowed revenge on the Global trooper who had destroyed them. Their father had put them together, secretly, using plans from another dimension. For days, Juvien had mourned the loss of the lightning gun. \nHer father had explained to Aza about the other dimensions, how he had come from one similar to their own. He wasn't really their father, but in his own world he had children identical to them, with different names. That was the first rule of dimensional travel, he had told her. You can't travel anywhere you don't already exist. Gates opened between congruent minds. Over the few years they had been prisoner on the cannon and their father's dimensional twin had aged into an old man, she had forgotten the two father's weren't the same. He told her he loved them as if they were his own. \nOn the mat in the middle of the room, the old man's eyes opened. “We leave tomorrow night,” he said, looking at each of them in turn. They were silent. “Now,” he said, “do you want to hear a story?”\n\n~Cannon\n“What if it's a trap?” EfSun asked. He was piloting a hover-sled, leaving a wake of dust and disturbed particles, under a bluish moon. The jagged teeth of mountains chewed on low-hanging clouds along the horizon. Nazkio was in a shadow mech, designed for stealth. \n“Then we both lose credit with Global,” he said. “On the other hand, if we take down the pulse cannon, you'll end up with a biped that makes the one you have now look like a toy.” He wasn't that different than EfSun, Nazkio thought, dreaming of the fleet-upgrades he would be able to afford. He had told the Captain of the battalion zone that there was a rogue Union scientist they were keeping trapped in the pulse cannon, who wanted to blow it up out of revenge. He was a mutant, Nazkio had explained, probably crazy from being kept that close to the gargantuan weapon's core. He hadn't reported the deal they had struck, or how he would help So's children escape. \n“Wow,” EfSun said, looking up at the gleaming cannon through the hover-sled's optics. The underside was a coruscated disk of gleaming metal plates, blacking out the stars. Nazkio double-checked the blue-prints So had given him, superstitiously verifying the ghost-codes and coordinates.\n“Okay,” Nazkio said. “You should be shielded, but circle along that ravine until the time we set. Think about the new weapons array waiting for you if we pull this off.” \n“I still think he's crazy,” EfSun said.\n“Yeah, me too.” Nazkio, thinking about dimensional travel, shot a magnetic grapple out of his mech's palm, and ascended out of the hover-sled, which coasted away into the desert. Spidering along the tiles of the cannon's belly, He found the maintenance panel and pulled it off. So was right, there were no alarms. Gingerly, he used the shadow-mechs anti-gravity treads to move through the tunnels, placing charges from his belt at the places the old man had indicated. Alone, they wouldn't be enough to do much damage, but So had assured him that if they exploded at the same time he over-charged the cannon's capacitors, it would bring the entire floating mega-weapon crashing to the Earth. \n“So,” he called on the short-wave relay when he was close enough. “Are you there?”\n“Power up your armor,” So said. “This close to the core your mech might start acting glitchy.” Not for the first time, Nazkio wondered how So and his children had managed to survive on board the cannon. The amount of genetic tinkering involved made his mind spin. It was impossible, unless, as Nazkio said, the knowledge really did come from worlds other than theirs. He would rescue the children, take them to the bunker, but what then? How would they survive? No civilized mobile army would pick up mutants, and as tough as EfSun had said they were in battle, they wouldn't last long on their own with the rogue enclaves.\nNazkio flattened himself the angle of a hatch-way while two droids clanked past, but So's encryptions held and they disappeared around the curved service corridor. He pressed on, the mech's radiation warnings flashing red. Checking his position against the map, he saw that he had overshot So's cell, and doubled back. At the small square portal, he called the old man again, telling him to open the door. \nSo's voice sounded from inside, more hoarse than usual. The door's locks clicked, and Nazkio pushed it open. The scientist was fighting back tears. “Take them,” he said, pointing to the severed heads of his daughter and two sons, floating in the milky water of cryogenic jars. Their bodies lay in mingled pools of blood. \n~Stasis\n\nNazkio fell the last few feet onto the sled. “What happened? Where are they?” EfSun's voice asked through the controls. Nazkio set the pack down without answering. “Just go,” he said. The nose of the sled lifted, then dug downward as the picked up speed. The gravitational engines whipped radioactive sand and dust into eddies and swirls. The moon looked like it was made of bone, and Mars glowing an angry, omniscient red. Behind them, the pulse cannon exploded, light from the short sequence of fire-balls followed by a roaring wave of sound.\nCHAPTER NINE: BIOSYS\n\n~ZOAS \nThe Sentinet found itself in a silent world. For the first time, it knew itself as alone, and separate from the biosphere of its post-human world of teeming, conscious, life. Identities in the gia-mind were fluid, as certain ideas and impulses lanced and waved through the distributed neural networks, made of trilliions of organisms, cells, and crystalline structures. \nIt was (it seems silly to use “he” or “she”), at the moment when the tiered structure of floating islands seemed to explode into crackling arcs of lightning, a small flock of long-winged, gliding birds, along with a colony of bacteria living in their guts, a school of small, darting fish, and a larger shark. It wasn't entirely alone, then, because it had itself, but its connection with the entire world had disappeared, like the sun suddenly dropping into the sea, plunging the world into darkness. The only reason the Sentient didn't plunge immediately into broken insanity, was because of the time it had spent near the floating islands, which most of the Sentients avoided because of the way it dampened and confused their thoughts. Zoas was used to that feeling, and had even landed, from time to time, among the human tribes, living in groves of ur-trees, in that terrible mental silence. \nNow, all the different parts of him reeling in confusion and sudden heat, it was if that muting and alienating field had stretched beyond all horizons. \nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT: -birds die, Zoas hides in the cool shadows 9the world is hot) then gradually sets out making copies of himself, spreading the Sentient genetics. \n~SEA TURTLE\n\n“Do you remember the Biosys project?” The sea-turtle asked them, telepathically. It had taken at least an hour before the research team had begun to come to terms with the fact that they were in a first encounter with dozens of previously unknown species, and at least another hour before they admitted to each other that they could hear the turtle's voice in their head. Guiltily, they had finally started asking each other if they were going crazy, or if the animals were speaking to them. Now they sat around, sipping hot tea, taking notes and photographs. \n“Some Chinese research team here two years ago?” Laoshi said.\n“They were trying to turn plant cells into processors, run a far-future model of the ecosystem.” That was BorQs. \n“Didn't it fail?” Aben asked. “I remember a lot of initial excitement, but then they lost their funding. I thought it was abandoned.”\n“It was abandoned,” the turtle said, telepathically “but it didn't fail.” They had laid a tarp on a circle of rocks, and filled it with water, adjusting the salinity until the creature (she had told the scientists to call her Xi) felt comfortable. In words and in something beyond them, almost but not quite images, Xi told them how the molecular automata had escaped the site, the bioware surviving in the incinerated ash, seeping into the rain-forest roots, and evolving on its own. \nNo matter how they had run the simulations on normal computers, the results were the same: extinction for the human species, and most other higher life forms, within 100 years. Modern civilization had been built on the continuous use of apergenetic resources, and humans could neither survive their continued use, nor stop their consumption. Biosys was supposed to find a solution. The idea had been that the logic circuits of a living computer would take on the malleability of biological life. The ecosystems programmed into the model weren't real, and less complex than natural systems by many orders of magnitude, but the Chinese researchers had hoped that by running it under various conditions they might eventually stumble on some solution the rest of the world's scientists had overlooked. \n“Evolutionary algorithms,” BorQs said, nodding. He looked at Indira, hoping to see some concession that his virtual modeling of ecosystems was vindicated, but the head scientist wasn't looking at him, her eyes moving from the turtle, to the sky, to the read-outs on her display. “This other dimension you are talking about. The world you come from, where humans don't exist. It was created by the bio-computer? All of these new species evolved within the simulation?”\n“No,” the sea-turtle thought to them. Laoshi, who was closest to it, kneeling beside the blue tarp, could have sworn it was smiling. “This is the problem with humans. It is why your world is dying. You think that it is possible to create things. Creation is a dangerous fallacy, almost as bad as discovery. Nothing in your history was ever created or discovered by humans. You maim, destroy, and reduce what is already in nature to the point where it is unrecognizable, and then affix your signature. The bio-computer didn't use the rain forest; it is the rain forest.” This time Indira glanced at BorQs, as if the turtle's thoughts proved what she had been saying all along. \nSeveral jelly-fish descended, drawn by the salty pool. The turtle, Xi, obliged them by splashing water on their bodies, which were luminescent with the same apergenetic parasites that lit up the underside of the turtle, making the water glow with teal-colored light.\n“This is a verge world,” the tortoise went on. “The transposition of physical matter, up until now, has been impossible. Information, though, can travel through dimensions. Your culture is full of stories of alternate earths.” She flapper her fins again. “Of course, you probably think you created those stories.”\nBorQs thought he understood. “Only information can travel across dimensions,” he said. “The Chinese researchers tried to use the molecular structure of the ur-trees to make their computer models behave like living systems. Instead, they turned the biological matter of the Amazon into a form that could be changed, at the level of information. That's how you were able to cross over.”\nThe turtle floated out of the pool, hovering above it, water dripping off of its intricately molded shell. The jelly-fish circled it like satellites. “The researchers lost interest in the models of the Amazon after human life became unsustainable, when Carbon dioxide had reached around 800 parts per million. Most of them were shut down. Like I said, some continued running, spreading through the root system. With more processing speed, the evolutionary algorithms could run faster, spin out more intricate subroutines. In the four years since the project was shut down, the bio-computers ran the automata through more than four million years of evolution.” He paused, looking directly at BorQs. “Do you know, from your world's fictions, the most important rule of dimensional travel?”\nBorQs nodded, thinking about his wife. “You can't go somewhere you haven't already been.” In the stories, people who switched minds with alternate selves always ended up in lives somehow like their own, in worlds that might have been drastically different on the surface, but shared an internal structure, an ineradicable causal logic. There had to be a continuity.\n“Yes,” the turtle said. “We couldn't just change four million years of your Earths. The only place where our species could appear on your planet was one where we could have evolved, plausibly, without contradicting this dimension's reality.”\n“The intangible zone,” Pico said. The ancient Peruvian had been silent the entire time, taking pictures through his lenses, writing in his notebook.\n“Yes,” the sea-turtle answered. “The intangible zone.”\n\nContinuities\n\nThat night, neither Laoshi nor Aben could sleep. For a long time, neither of them could talk about what had happened, as if there were still caught in two realities, and it was only in one of them that their research station had drifted into an ecosystem from an alternate dimension, and they had spent the day talking, telepathically, to flying sea creatures. Instead, they lay in their cot, jelly-fishing their hands and feet against one another, looking up at the stars through the mosquito netting. The wind had picked up, and the trees, also, were sighing under one another's touch, playing a larger vertical version of Laoshi and Aben's X and Y-ing of their arms and legs. \n“What?” Laoshi asked, turning to see Aben staring at her. \n“Practicing my telepathy,” he said. It was a joke, but Laoshi suddenly felt conscious of her heartbeat, the surface of her skin, the smell of his hair, and the millions of years of evolution that had designed her eyes and brain to take the smallest turn of mouth or direction of a pupil and construct, out of that, a model of the mind of the man lying next to her. She wondered how accurate it really was.\nThey had left the global relay on, volume turned low, and from the unsleeping awe and urgency of the voices she knew that other contacts were being made with the new sentient species. In the mountains of Tibet, on the coast of Indonesia, even in the heavily populated antarctic and arctic poles, new flora and fauna were being reported. Long-hidden islands were rising like lost cities out of the seas and oceans, dripping with unimagined life. Science as they knew it was undergoing convulsions, the fringe and centers flopping into one another's places. A dying planet was waking up from toxic catatonia, stirred by thoughts from other worlds. \n“It's just so random,” Aben said. “We were working on something, like a puzzle, that seemed difficult but possible to solve. There was at least some logic to the missing pieces, and now...”\n“The game has changed,” Laoshi said. “a dimension has been added, is all. It's still a puzzle, we just have to look at it differently.”\nAben snorted. “It's more than that,” he said. “It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't follow from anything that came before.”\n“Doesn't it? No one has ever been able to explain anti-gravity. Urboreal science has grown around an essential fact that is inarguably unscientific. It's zero-point energy, which all physical laws and logic preclude from possibility. Things float. We cover that up with all kinds of hypothesis and formula, studied it from every angle, but local reversals of the Earth's electro-magnetic fields, like what happens in the ur-tree roots, has never made sense. Unless, like the sea-turtle said, the roots can grow between dimensions.”\n“Still,” Aben said, “this might change everything. From what they said, they might be able to cross genetics of species from our Earth with theirs. Even if their planet is dying, too, the combination might bring enough diversity to re-start the biosphere. I just wish...I wish it would have been something that we did, not just some mistake, a glitch in a computer game...”\nThe anonymous sounds of insects crescendoed briefly, bringing a strange smell into the air. “Do you wish it was us?” she asked, “instead of them?” \nAben shook his head. “The Sentients, when they were talking about the drift, they said: you can't go to a dimension unless you're already there. If what they are saying is true, the game has always been larger than this one Earth. We've always been shaped by other versions of ourselves, a landscape of invisible possibility under what we can actually see, the choices we actually make.” The night fell around them like eternity: thick. He pulled Laoshi's small body close. “It wouldn't change anything. The only continuities that matter are those you can't escape.”\n\n~Herons and Crows\n\nNo one had been allowed into the intangible zones in all recorded history. If there were humans inside them, they were the last indigenous cultures anywhere on earth not contacted by representatives of global capitalism. Now BorQs and Pico were flying into a pre-dawn sky on the back of a flying turtle and sea-lion, crossing across a boundary not only into unknown geography but through a dimensional gate into another world.\nTraveling through dimensions wasn't the same thing as traveling through time: you couldn't visit your own continuity's past, or visit your own world in the future. Whatever battles a species was fighting, a planet they could travel into would have the same problems. \nAfter the other researchers had left the station in the flying grove, they had waited as the interconnected mass of trees, and the ecology of its roots, flew into the intangible area. Then Pico had climbed onto the back of the turtle, and BorQs accepted a ride from a telepathic sea-lion. “This is just like a game I used to play,” BorQs said to the old Peruvian who Indira had sent as their representative. The Sentients had offered them the possibility of creating corridors between the habitable zones, which might stave off the worse of the predicted die-off. Maybe, BorQs thought, he would be able to see his wife again. \nThey had left just after midnight, and as the sun was rising, they saw that the mountain they had been approaching was actually floating above the forest, a thin strip of dawn-streaked violet visible underneath, filigreed by vines, roots, and the shadows of migrating birds. The grove they had been studying for the past four years was the largest known to science. This, though, was an entire peak of the Andes lifted from its base of mountains, lifted dripping into the air. Underneath, they saw, was water, denser than any cloud. Caught in the anti-gravitational pull of the enormous flying ecosystem was a sea, with fish, octopii, and corals floating in its field. The sun rose through the water, highlighting the life caught in glowing shadow plays. \n“Why do you think she sent us?” BorQs asked. Indira had chosen the two of them, over the mild protests of several others, to accept the Sentient's offer of visiting their home-world, and following the floating sea as it made its way over the Andes to the Pacific. \n“You are a computer modeling expert. The Chinese simulation was how the ur-trees were able to pull genetics from the drift. It makes sense to send you as ambassador.” Their clothing was soaked from the spray, their shirts hanging damp across their shoulders. Borqs ran his fingers through his hair, shaking out salt-water. It wasn't just that, BorQs thought. Before they had left, Indira had called him into her lab. They had never gotten along, and for half an hour the old woman, her white hair pulled back into a vivid bun above her dark skin, had harangued him on equipment and procedure, pulling maps and tables from drawers, downloading data into his lenses. Suddenly, in the middle of going over how to process field-samples of DNA, she had stopped talking, reaching over and grabbing his hand in one of her wrinkled ones. \n“You realize,” she had said. “The game hasn't really changed. This isn't some magic bridge to find her. It is possible, though. If this works. You might be able to see her again.” Yes, BorQs had thought. Kamala, though, would still want a divorce. There is more separating us now than just dimensions. \nThe animals carrying Pico and BorQs cleared the crumbling lip of the enormous floating rain-forest, landing on a stony beach above, not next to, its ocean. The turtle and sea-lion had been silent for the journey; their telepathy, the first Sentients had explained, depended on a large number of organisms. They had individual minds, but were linked through the huge flocks of birds, who had, collectively, the capacity for approximating human thought-linguistics. Gulls, parrots, and smaller avians hovered now in flocks, circling in clouds of babble. Pico slid off the back of the turtle, and BorQs dismounted from the rough back of the sea-lion. “You can go by foot the rest of the way,” the creature said, turning his whiskered face towards a path up the flying mountain, wreathed in yellow clouds. \nThe sun climbed the sky faster than they climbed the trail, working the stiffness out of their legs. They talked about the species they saw, speculated on the role this added level played in an ecosystem, what determined its movements. BorQs found himself thinking about another video game that had been his favorite in his early twenties. It was called Herons and Crows, and was a fantasy world he had played through with some of his friends. The content was subversive enough, supposedly, to be banned by several of the world's corporate governments (larger, more adult versions of the granny-cloud he had suffered as a child). For hundreds of years, apergenetic civilizations had been based on a number of presupposed equations: progress equaled technology, and technological superiority manifested itself in height, rising literally and metaphorically above other industrial societies. Until recent history, the idea that drift-feul was limited, or that the floating metropolises were dependent upon the health of a larger ecosystem and would fall if that ecosystem collapsed, was unthinkable. Human civilization would continue to rise, pushing the apex of cultural evolution ever higher, until they populated the stars. \nThe fantasy world of Herons and Crows had implicitly argued what scientists and the more thoughtful historians had already concluded: that in a moral landscape, physical altitude was matched by a corresponding depravity. The white cities of the Crows, the gleaming towers, fluttering pennants and armored knights, the clerics and nominal heroes, concealed hypocrisy and evil. Meanwhile, the Herons, the vilified outcasts, mutants, and monsters, roaming the shadowed hinterlands, were the most fun characters to play. The level BorQs was thinking of, as he and the old (embarrassingly unwinded) Peruvian followed the flashes of tail-feathers up the trail, was when he had been playing a dark knight, chasing an evil wizard up the side of a similar floating mountain.\nThe game was pirated, open-sourced, developed not by the industry but crowd-sourced by alternative developers who used gaming as an engine for political speculation and debate. Often, the levels and adventures were moralistic, drawn from old folk tales or stories. Rather than the more sophisticated synaptics, Herons and Crows used repurposed and obsolete somatic sensors and controls, so you actually had to approximate the physical actions of your gaming sprites or avatars: to play you had to wear ridiculous-looking pads on your joints, which could lock up in varying resistances to approximate in-game interactions. Climbing the mountain to chase the good/evil wizard, then, had been hard exercise, which explained why BorQs, sweating, was thinking of it as he climbed higher into the inter-dimensional Andes. \nAt some point, BorQs remembered, the climbing had become nearly impossible, and his character was forced to remove pieces of his armor, trading protection for mobility. It was a hard decision, because he had worked hard to earn every grieve, gauntlet, and buckler, and once he left them behind he could never get them back. The tower-shield went first, followed by the helmet, chest-plate, and so on, until even the massive sword became too heavy to carry. The wizard, like the sentient flock of birds, had always preceded him, just out of reach, luring him upward. Finally, armorless, exhausted and unprotected, he had arrived at a cave, and inside was the dark mage, wearing his armor, covered completely, wielding his sword. \nLooking back, he realized how obvious the metaphor had been, like most of the quests: the human species, in order to survive, would have to give up, one after another, the heavy accoutrements of civilization on which it prided itself: the pre-packaged food, chemical industries, soaring apergenetic architecture, inter-continental air-ships, electronics, nuclear weapons, and satellites. Humans would have to, the logic of the game suggested, divest themselves of every piece of technological and ideological armor they believed they had earned over thousands of years of civilized destruction. In the end, it was a dehumanized and demonic form of their own thoughts and machines that they would have to face, swordless and naked. \n“Why do you think Indira chose you?” BorQs asked, continuing their earlier conversation. He had been too polite to ask before, but as they walked he had grown more curious what the old man would say. He was silent for a while, his breathing even and slow.”\n“I know about these creatures,” Pico said finally. “Before I meet Indira, and joined the research station, I studied them. Not in the way you do.” He tapped his forehead, squinting and smiling. “I used to live in the intangible zone.”\nCHAPTER TEN: PENNY DREADFUL II\n\nSpavens was eating beans in winter, mixing it with deer jerky, knowing that it probably didn't matter if he made a fire or not. His wrecked arm couldn't hold a fork, and saturated his nervous system with cold, lancing pain. It had snowed, and there was no way of obscuring tracks, especially when the thing being hunted, him, was bleeding. He had disobeyed the order to execute the deserter, firing instead on the Colonel who had given the command. The reversal of military discipline in a gunshot. The court martial had been held the night before, in secret, and Captain Taylor would be killed at dawn. Colonel Geer had given him the order to fire, along with nine other men, when his count reached zero. When it had reached one, Spavens had shot him instead. Then dropped his gun, not wanting to point it at anyone else. The fact that he had walked, not ran, probably saved his life. By the time anyone was given a countermanding order, he was already well away from camp. They were also too busy capturing Taylor. \nSpavens saw him shot, a barely visible uniform, falling. Sharpshooter, he thought, as the bullet shattered the bone in his arm. He had mixed in a clove of garlic he always carried in his jacket. The can of beans had been in the bag with his powder-horn and amunition. Battle was just chaos, he thought, and bravery just betting on shots fired through smoke, mass suicide on both sides that declared nothing about the winner except willingness to slaughter men like butchering cattle, officers shooting them from above like they used to shoot buffalo from trains. The revolutionary war, in his father's time, at least had more of the close-range dangers of bayonets, and calvalry charges. Now it was an extension of banking, or human balance sheets. War got rid of surplus population in the same way that the colonies' markets got rid of surplus production.\nThe rest of his life, Spavens would tell anyone who would listen that you should always be careful what you were thinking about, because you might get shot in the head and be unable to form new memories. He told people that his last thoughts were about the futility of war. Really, though, he had been wishing he had more to drink. He'd gone through a long one-armed ordeal to get the cap off the bottle, only to find less than a sixth of whiskey. Then the rifle ball knocked him unconscious. \n\n~ SpavenS\nIt was as if Spavens were living in two different words. In one, he was twenty-nine, a Captain in the Confederate army, and a spy receiving coded instructions from the North. In the other, he was a grey-bearded old man with one arm, a limp, and a scar on his temple. The one thing that stayed the same was the meaningless terror of violence. While in the war, it had occurred to him that it didn't really matter which side he was on: he could kill rebels just as efficiently by sending them into battle as by leading the Blue-coats against them. It was all just slaughter, trees mowed into splinters by artillery fire, rivers choked with corpses. Without the uniforms, it would be impossible to tell who to shoot. To the birds, it made no difference.\nWar, it appeared, was a means of population control, following from the new doctrines of evolutionary selection. Reality was becoming more like the flash-portraits captured on chemical type-sheets. \nThe war had ended in 1865. Now it was 1892, and he was pointing a gun at a man in uniform, but he wasn't a soldier. There was a single bar on his chevron, indicating Lieutenant. They were in Chicago. He was with the police. The policeman raised his gun and fired.\n“Move!” Roger said, and the dark-haired young man, Orlando, grabbed Zabella (she had grown up so fast!). They were in a marbled hall, books and papers on benches and floors. One of the high windows had been broken, the cold winds blowing past the boarded-up sack-cloth, causing stacks of documents to test their paperweights. The furniture was massive, including the gold-lined legal bench they were crouched behind. As if having a city-above-the-city wasn't enough, the new industrial centers of the midwest had to make their floating buildings as heavy as possible, to make the feat of floating above them more awe-inspiring to the poor and homeless masses.\nSpavens followed Malwise, his daughter, and Orlando into the hall, back out into the warmthless sunlight, onto the tangled flying arcades and sub-structures connecting the rail-station to the city below. The sound of steel braking on steel, the titan griding of drift-powered engines, swept over them with the wind, causing the walkways to sway. The streets and bridges were filled with a mid-day crowd, some of whom growled angrily as Orlando pushed through them. Spavens, desperately, tried to remember what was happening.\nOne. They were on their way west to try to find the mysterious author of the California Bandit stories. Two. When they had gotten off the train in Chicago, a young boy had tugged on Roger's coat. “Are you Roger Malwise?” he had asked, and receiving an affirmative had handed the ex-minister a book wrapped in brown packing-paper, like they used in butcher shops. The boy, even after being given a tip, had lingered, shifting from one worn-out shoe to the other. When questioned, he had pointed to one of the Pushman guards, talking to a police officer. “I think we need to go,” Orlando had said. Three. They ran.\n“There!” Roger said, pointing far below them to where a group of rail workers, their hats and shoulders black from soot, were striking. He was panting; the suit-case filled with books was slowing him down. In order to get to the stock-yards, still filled with over-turned freight cars and wreckage from previous strikes, they had to go through the spiral arms of platforms and buildings of market street, the floating auction houses above the abbotoirs and grain elevators, loading docks and streets of legal offices.\n\n~Stockyards\n\nNo. That had all been days ago. They had made it to the stockyards, behind the picket line. The Pushman guards couldn't risk being seen helping the Chicago police, not after the riots, so they had been safe, for a while. Malwise, when he had caught up, had even taken the bullhorn, and climbed onto the stage of packing crates the Levellers had set up, holding a copy Boston 2251 as if it were a bible, shouting about social evolution and how the printing press would break the shackles of industrial slavery. The labor leaders had formed a protective circle around them, street urchins throwing stones at the Pushman's mercenary soldiers. Orlando had met some drifters he had traveled with before, and just before dawn they had shown them how to sneak onto an empty freight car, the rails headed South and West.\nNow Spavens was pointing a gun, this time at a well-dressed man with a monocle and mustache standing behind a table with a green-lamp and ledger books. The man had a small service revolver aimed back at him. He was a Blinkerton, one of the private strong-men and detectives trailing them from Boston. Spavens had no way of knowing this, but Malwise recognized him as the man he had spoken to in the train-station cafe. Orlando and Zabella were tied up back-to-back on an expensive carpet, gagged with dirty strips of cloth. What was happening? \nHe had woken up on the cold planks of the freight car, every bone stiff from the cold and constant bouncing. Malwise was shouting at another man, dressed in a Pushman's uniform. He had been punched, and his mouth and nose were bleeding. They had already taken Orlando and Isabella, along with the briefcase of books. Roger was put in handcuffs, and they were taken from the train station onto a floating river-boat, a huge steam-powered paddle wheel turning meaninglessly in the air, lit from the underside with the glow of apergy. They walked passed a luxury dining room, roulette tables, games of high-stakes poker. Into this room. The mustachiod man had Roger's briefcase open, and was throwing books into the brass fireplace. The Pushman guard threw them roughly toward the desk.\n“Now,” the man had said, “give us the book you received in Chicago, and you will all be free to go.”\nThe Pushman guard had walked behind the desk, said something the Captain, with his damaged hearing, missed. He saw, however, Orlando's eyes widen in fear. He had recognized the Pushman guard as the one who had tried, earlier, to throw him from the train. \n“You may take your daughter,” The Blinkerton said. “The boy, I'm afraid, is going to stay with us.” Isabella screamed, turning her head one way and then another, to plead with the detective, and then with her father. Spavens had reached into his boot and drawn his revolver, and the Blinkerton likewise pulled one from under the hardwood desk. \nThe only time in his life he had ever shot someone (that he remembered at least) was when he had turned and fired on the Colonel who had given him the order to execute the man they thought was a spy and a deserter. He felt now the same certainty he did then. War was firing into clouds of gunsmoke, masses of men, the ambiguity and randomness of mechanized and impersonal slaughter. After becoming a spy, his certainty had been destroyed. His moral aim had drifted, unsure if the thing they were firing at had less right to live than the thing he was ordering to fire. The war, he had discovered, was a contest between one kind of slavery and another, one set of blood-crazed generals or those wearing a different color of uniform. The robber-barons had, since the war, transformed the country into an even bloodier and total plantation, two levels of society, one casting its choking shadow on the other. The man he was pointing his revolver at, and the one next to him, were unimportant functionaries. The real faces of power were those he would never see, in offices and pleasure boats larger even than this. Shoot them, and their suits and uniforms would be filled with someone else. They were soldiers of monopoly, lifting the railways and banking houses with arms given steel by stolen capital, boots crushing the skulls of those underneath.\n“Roger?” The Captain said, wondering if he was remembering things correctly.\n“He should be shot,” Malwise said. \nSpavens fired, as did the Blinkerton, both men going down, Isabella screaming. For the Captain, the sound of the gunshot was the same as that twenty-eight years ago, his mouth filling with the taste of deer-jerky and beans. The steam-boat became the dry stream-bed in the Carolinas, a few miles North from the Confederate camp. The two bullets were the same, finally finishing the trajectory they had started so long ago. This time, they hit him squarely in the heart. \n~Drift City\n\nGeese flew in bifurcating Vs above them as they walked across the field. The farmer had come up and talked to Malwise outside the town square in Drift City, Utah, after the policeman had told them to disperse. The officer was skeptical of his claim to be a book peddler, because other than the latest volume of Joquin Valeza, the California Bandit, he didn't have any books. He and Orlando had survived by jumping from the floating casino into the Missouri River. His daughter, with a broken leg, hadn't. \n“They think you are a Dissenter,” the man said to him, gesturing towards the policeman, now strutting back and forth in front of the town's saloon. “They have been giving a lot of sermons here lately, drawing people away from the regular church.” \n“How do you know?” Roger asked. \n“I am one.\" \nMalwise had agreed to stay with the man's family for the night. He had asked the farmer his name, and the man said they didn't use names. He didn't ask very many questions. Both Orlando and Roger were wanted men. Orlando hadn't spoken since Isabella died. \nThe defrocked minister felt the leaves getting softer under his feet, and looked down to find himself floating. The farmer was, too, and had begun to make fish-like movements with his hands as he walked. “There's a drift grove here,” the nameless man said, “growing upside down.”\nIt explained the unusual numbers of animals. \nThe last floating ur-tree forest in the Americas was about to touch down in California, after the native tribes had been forced onto the grove after those farther East had become depleted or made into settlements, linked by floating rails. Hundreds of years in the future, Malwise thought, historians would remember Ghost Grove as the site of a massacre, the direct result of a new nation's genocidal urge to plunder. Supposedly, a tribal chieftan had fired first. The ur-trees were still healthy enough that the height of the island was enough to kill anyone driven over its edges. Out of the thousands of native men, women, and children on the island, none had survived. Ideology and geography, suffering and capital, literacy and genocide, would be mapped by the future as overlapping landscapes. \nAt dinner, which they ate with the man's wife, daughter, and two sons, he explained that they were forced West for religious dissent: they didn't believe in anything written down. Books of all kind were taboo. The invisible drift-grove traveled with them, lightening their steps. Other than that, they had no set beliefs. When they learned that Malwise was an ex-minister himself, having been defrocked after his first public sermon, they asked what the sermon had been about. Malwise glanced uncertainly at the younger children.\n“Evolution,” he said. They stared at him, expecting more. \n“We don't have a church,” the man said, “but we would like to hear you give it. Again, I mean. You can change it if you like.”\nThe children were devouring bowls of peas and soup. The windows of the house had no glass, only wooden bars, so when the wind turned into rain it blew diagonally halfway through the room, droplets landing in the bowls, causing them to ring with circles. \n“My best friend shot someone four days ago,” Malwise said. “I told him to. Then he was killed, as I must have known he would be. There was another man there, a Pushman guard. I shot him. We pretended my daughter was a hostage. Her leg was broken. They had broken her leg. She couldn't swim. What happens in one story affects what happens in the others. That's the only thing I can tell you.”\nOutside the windows, seasons were changing, suns and moons flashing diurnal rhythms between the windows. Roger could see, outside, the inverted drift-tree grove as a ghost forest, primeaval, underground branches heavy with 60,000 years of circular narrative. They were telepaths. Orlando had gone back to eating soup, either ignoring or immune to the visions. The nameless family were still staring at him.\n“Where do you think we are?” he asked them. “Really?” \nCHAPTER ELEVEN: COMICI MALFAMATI II\n\nInstead of answering, the nameless man excused himself and went into another room, returning with a package. “This arrived for you yesterday by mail,” he said,handing the book to Malwise. \n\nIt was on the journey that they became a companie, an acting troupe capable of thinking and moving like a single organism, anticipating one anothers' thoughts, setting up one anothers' jokes. Their slapstick and pantomime developed into elaborate routines, set pieces of staged violence and vulgarity that they honed like a blade against the laughter of their audiences.\nAn almost telepathic ability to read the thoughts of the other actors developed between them, along with an extra sense attuned to the moods of the audience, the timing and tide-turning of favor or impatience. \nThey played in village squares, inns, fair grounds, and remote cottages where familes of shepherds or pig farmers would put them up for the night. At times they traded the larger portions of their dignity for an evening meal. For the most part they slept outside, under the stars, except for Lucrezia who slept in the coach. Although the height of the old commedia had come and gone, there were still large numbers of vagabondi, itinerant actors roaming the countryside, spreading news and gossip. \nBecause of their small number, they often performed with other troupes, sometimes acquiring an extra zanni or a Columbine for a stretch of the journey. They would trade plots, jokes, and bits of comic business, learning from another as much as they could before parting ways. The masks, or characters, were known throughout the provinces, and although there were local variations the tradition was such that performers could easily adapt to new actors, like musicians with a common store of songs or folk melodies. \nThe system of theatrical performances dealt more with prosaic matters than readers of later ages might assume, things like crop yields, the reputation of local land-owners, or news of foreign wars. Often crude pantomimes were simply the most effective way to convey information across noisy rooms or open fields at night. \nThey were accosted occasionally by bandits, theives, and collectors of tolls for some overzealous lord, who learned that Lombarqo's sword was not merely a stage-prop. The dust of the roads worked into their skin and clothes, until they could wash themselves in a river, or simply wait for rain. \nThere were rumors of Hugeunots, Spaniards, and stranger things. In every village the consensus was that danger and difficulty lay ahead, and they had best turn back and return from whence they came. \n\n~Mask\n\nTwo sturdy donkeys carried the wagon over narrow mountain roads. When the weather was good, they folded the panels of the roof back to let the leaves of the hidden Ur-tree soak up the sunlight. On good days it would float a man's height into the air, easing the strain on the donkeys harness, but causing them to bray in fear as the stage-coach rose behind them. It rained often, and although the days were getting longer the winds were more biting as they went higher in the Alps. \nLombarqo, their Capitano, rode one of the donkeys, with Rosla walking beside him. Ginqualo, who had been feeling ill, was riding in the tree-filled wagon, along with their Dottore and the Harlequin, Lucrezia. The lover was working on his lazzi, love-sick speeches that his character could use to fill the gaps in improvisation.\n“As the unckecked rivers smile wanderingly towards the sea, obeying the pull of deepest earth, my thoughts are drawn always to the declivity of your absence, the telos and purpose of all my journeys.” This was accompanied by tearful eyes and elaborate gestures. “Isn't this supposed to be funny?” Ginqualo asked, chewing on the duck-feather he had been using as a fountain pen.\nThe Dottore answered, “the only way to make pople laugh is by trying to be as sincere as possible. To find the most treasured parts of yourself and offer it for ridicule. Every mask is the thing it pretends to be, and the polar opposite. My character, ergo, per exemplum, says wise things foolishly. A lover must be filled with ridiculous sincerity. He believes in the beauty of his own words, which makes his speeches laughable.” He pointed to Lucrezia. “The Harlequin is both stupidity and cunning, a servant, the lowest of the low, out of which the truth is sometimes squeezed like oil from an olive, by his gluttony and stupidity. His wisdom has been driven out of his mind into his body and appetites.”\n“This mask was my father's,” Lucrezia said, handing it to the boy. “He claimed that Arlecchino was like a ghost inhabiting the paint and leather. When he wore it, a veil between worlds was lifted, and transformations and transpositions possible.”\nThe coach had stopped, and Lucrezia undid the latch and stepped outside. She heard music: drums, fiddles, and wooden flutes. Small fires dotted the valley in front of them, men and women watering horses and washing clothes in the clear-running stream. “Roma,” Lombarqo said. \nAs they entered the camp, several of the men came up and examined their donkeys. They ignored the greetings of Lombarqo and the doctor, speaking to one another in their own language as they ran their sun-darkened fingers across the animals' legs, ribs, and forelocks.\n“What are they saying?” Lombarqo asked Rosla.\n“That we should feed them more oats, less hay. We have been riding them too hard, and one of their shoes is loose, and he could break his leg.”\n“Why are they looking at our donkeys?” Lucrezia asked, eying them suspiciously.\n“They want to know what kind of people we are. They're deciding whether or not to let us stay in their camp.” She said something to the gypsies, and one of the men nodded. The other, with a thick grey beard obscuring half of his face, the other half obscured by a wide-brimmed straw hat, unhooked the animals from the harness and led them to the stream. \nDozens of children poured out of the wagons and tents, half-naked despite the chilly evening air, climbing onto the stage-coach and pulling back its curtains. Curiosity about the Italian actors seemed confined to the very young and the very old, who watched them with with deep unmoving eyes and habitual frowns, their eyes squinted and wrinkled from long decades of wandering beneath the sun. Everyone else continued with whatever they were doing before the strangers arrived: cooking, mending clothes, or playing music. The women acted horrified when Lucrezia moved to help them prepare a meal, although they accepted some of the dried apricots she had brought from Venice. Lombarqo joined the musicians with his Spanish guitar, although he found their frenetic melodies hard to follow, drifting in and out of minor and major scales. \nAfter dinner, when the sun had set, they converted the wagon into a stage, folding out the sides into a rough proscenium. The Roma saw the young ur-tree for what it was, whispering among themselves when Malwise pulled the blanket off its branches. They performed “The Servant With no Master,” playing up the pantomime and slapstick to the delight of the barefoot children. The musicians played along with Lombarqo and Rosaletta, picking up the melodies perfectly after hearing them once, adding their own trills and variations, the small tin and copper drums echoing off the cliffs. Strong brandy distilled from plums and other fruits was passed around in jars. \nAfter most of the camp had gone to sleep, laying their blankets out under the stars, huddling together for warmth, Rosla had gone to the stream to wash and check on the donkeys. The three-quarters moon had risen, close enough to the horizon to appear red and swollen. As she was splashing the cold water on her face and arms, she heard a voice behind her. “What are you doing here?” It was the bearded man who had looked after the donkeys, sitting with his back on a gnarled and stumpy tree, its roots exposed by the stream-bed. “Where are you going?”\nThey went for a walk, away from the camp, Rosla unafraid of the old man she felt like she knew from her own childhood. She told him about Versaille, their invitation to perform at the Sun King's court, because Lucrezia was the daughter of a famous Arlecchino. The Roma understood the commedia, having their own versions of improvised comedy and masks, legends and songs tended like horses, or trees, over thousands of kilometers and hundreds of years. She told him also about her own tribe, the long cycles of travel East and West, looping down through Anatolia, along the coast of the Black Sea up through the Carpathians, following the signs and directions other bands of Roma left Scaped into the paint of doorways or in the trunks of trees. They were a nation of information and music, rather than geography. If they ever stopped moving, they would go insane. As a people, they would die, forced to live in the sty's of cities, under laws that cared nothing for their culture or way of life. \n“Why did you leave your family?” The old Romani asked her. \nRosla shrugged. She felt a sense of an old, splintered fragment a broken part of the past had left lodged in her behavior and self-image.\nThe gypsies had noticed how the Italians had played some of their songs, that Rosla must have taught them. Some of the older men were angry, and suggested the young girl be put on trial for breaking taboo. They had also murmured at Lucrezia on stage dressed in mens' clothing, the patched costume of the servant-acrobat. The stream passed through a narrow cleft, over current-polished stones. Rosla and the old man, who had given his name as Zepho, started to walk back to the tents and dying fires. “You are making the same mistake now that you did when you left your tribe,” he said, looking at the stars instead of her. \n“What do you mean?” \n“The performance you gave tonight. You will never do so well again.” He paused. “My wife says that the boy traveling with you is very sick. He will never leave these mountains.”\n“He is the Dottore's nephew. In real life, I mean, not only in the play. They are the one's who wanted to go to France.” Rosla pulled her shawl around her shoulders, shivering. “Fifty years ago, the Italian comedies were popular all over Europe. The cities were filled with Capitanos, Pantalones, and Dottores, and every village, no matter how small, had their own amateur theatricals. Now it's only puppet shows. Operas and plays written down, every word and action memorized, repeated over and over without variation.”\nZepho looked at her from the corner of his dark eyes. “You are good at pantomime and tumbling. The best I have seen in my walking life. The reason is because you give your body to gravity. You have learned, like us, that the Earth is the only real actor in any play. The songs are only trees speaking in translation. The others traveling with you, they still think that their art can lift them above the ground. I know what that tree is you carry with you in your wagon. At the same time you mock the king, you travel towards him, drawn to the illusions he represents. Listen carefully: those who build palaces hate the forests. Those who worship courts and monarchs hate themselves, and want to all men into obedient soldiers, and all women into willing slaves. The closer you get to the centers of wealth, the less you will remember of your humanity, and connection with all other life that cannot be ordered or controlled. You will bow and Scape, or disappear. No matter what argument or script you prepare for this performance, the message will be the same: abjection, and inferiority at the feet of vanity and pride. How big of an audience do you really need?”\nRosla looked at the camp, as the path by the stream opened up into the valley. She thought of the play, and wondered if Zepho might be right, if as human actors they had only translated what the sky and mountains were saying all along. If at the Sun King's court performing comedy would be impossible in the shadow of the actual comic tragedy of a fat, bewigged and bepowdered tyrant with twenty attendants to help him with his morning toilet, and twenty more waiting in line, scheming in desperate hope to be one of the fortunate few who handed his highness the scented fabric he used to wipe his ass, or held the bowl in which he spat, or washed his hands. \nShe knew their journey to the Summer palace was doomed, and the letter of invitation faked. The entire Earth, though, was falling in the shadow of empires. Soon all roads would be guarded by soldiers, and all performances, no matter how small, dedicated to the king. The only thing left to do was travel to the heart of human madness, and try to tumble, or tell a joke.\n\n~ Versailles\n\nThey arrived in Versailles In mid-summer, quarantined in a nearby city for weeks before being allowed to leave. From a distance, they could see the enormous wings of the chateau, which appeared to be built on a high plateau. As they got closer, they saw that the entire estate was floating. The enormity of marble and stone suspended above pools and gardens created a palpable sense of wealth along with royal and noble privilege. In the Dottore it created a sadness, and in Lucrezia envy, ambition, and desire. The Captain, of course, saw the battlements and patrolling mounted guards.\nCaptain Lombarqo had seen uproot-trees before, and even, once when he had hired himself to minor tyrant-princes as a mercenary, had seen castles and mansions with sections hovering above the ground, but Versailles was a more massive project than any he would have thought possible.\nThe Sun King had been planning to move his court to the summer palace for years, and thousands, from hundreds of principalities, had toiled in its preparation, draining the surrounding swamps, transplanting the trees, carving stone, and constructing the enormous chateaus. The palace was on the summit of the floating forest, with the subordinate buildings sprawling on lower groves, in an unmistakeable symbolism. Up-trees, which had gone nearly extinct in Western Europe, had been shipped from the New World at tremendous cost. The walls of the palace, it was said, were even built from up-wood, the timber retaining some of its apergenetic properties. \nLombarqo had long wondered at the human need to place oneself above others—a seemingly inescapable, near-universal, instinct to amass and abuse as much power as possible. Soldiers hoarded the power to kill, merchants the power to own, and nobles the power to command, but all of it, eventually, became expressed in the insatiable thirst for higher ground. As a mercenary, he had seen lords and generals who marshalled great armies to kill men, rape women, and burn any village or hamlet refusing to acknowledge their authority, or offering the slightest insult. Often this slaughter was done in the name of religion, the god in the highest elevation of them all, or for some abstract political ideology, but what it came down to was the same dark, perverting force that had caused the Sun King to raise himself on a throne of absolute power and unprecedented opulence. Even in a continent of kings and tyrants, the French monarchy had taken the doctrine of divine right to a new level.\nHe and other petty tyrants had exhausted or burned all of the up-root trees in their own kingdoms long ago, and so sent pirates and plunderers out to collect the abundant forests in the newly discovered continents and islands beyond the Pacific. To the native inhabitants, they brought disease, death, and the destruction of the floating groves on which their way of life depended. The Sun King's ships (and those of other Queens) may sail West on the water, but returning East, they flew dazzlingly in the sun, showering gold and treasures, their masts of the armadas glowing green with freshly-hewn sky-sap. This had been how the Old World's capitols had risen so distant from the earth. \nGrazano took the Letter from the Marquis to the flying quarter, but quickly learned that an introduction alone was insufficient to gain entrance. He refused to relinquish the letter to the callous dignitaries, and they in turn refused to grant him admission, so he could present the letter to someone closer to the Marquis' inner circle. \nTheir first show was on a street corner from the unfolded coach, and it grew a small crowd of favorable onlookers until court officials, flanked by soldiers of the French guard, told them they were not allowed to perform without a permit. One of the bureaucrats, wearing a wig twice as big as his head, confiscated the few coins that had been thrown into the large helmet Lombarqo had thrown in front of the stage. It was one of their lazzis for the Captain to forget that they had used his head-piece as a busking-jar, and have the coins shower on his shoulders and the stage, to the horror of Grazano, who would chase down the money, bent double, occasionally magically overcoming his age to pounce on a stray dubloon like a cat. Those who knew what was coming might be incentivized to drop a coin (true, most were counterfeit, but genuine counterfeits) into the helmet. They hadn't done that Lazzi since they left Torn in the Spring. \nLuckily, another troupe of Italian actors who had come to Versaille took pity on them, and let them use their own theater for rehearsals and an occasional performance. \"It was the same in Paris,\" one of the actors explained to them. \"The queen would invite the most famous troupes to perform, and when they arrived they discovered that they were defenseless against the local theater guilds, who had the ear of Parliament.\"\nSure enough, as soon as their performances started to fill the small theater, a converted tennis court that offered little and inconvenient seating, officials arrived to inform them that the Parliament had issued an edict, effective immediately, banning all performances in Italian. Such a law was necessary to protect the integrity of the court and the King's theaters. The infamous comedians, closing their theater for two weeks in June, applied themselves to the French language, translating and memorizing stray bits their favorite lazzi. Since most of their performances relied on pantomime, their popularity when they re-opened was greater than ever, especially among the gallery, where the yoemen could watch the show for free, and delighted and their mangled grammar and accents. Several of the players' malapropisms actually made their way into the ironic speech of the French. \nAfter forbidding them to speak Italian in the shows, the floating Parliament, at the behest of the Sun King's outer council, next banned Italians from speaking French. Such a law was necessary to protect the integrity of the French language and the morals of the local youth. The matter was taken up in several broadsheets, and became a favorite item of gossip and speculation. The night of the performance following this proclamation, the small theater was over-run with tradesmen and nobles wanting to see how the Italian comedians might react. \nIn the opening scene, Lucrezia, the most famous of the company, walked onto the proscenium in her patched Harlequin costume, and sang. The songs were illegal, printed in dark rooms on bad paper and spread covertly, rolled into thin tubes and stuffed in canes. Copies continued to sell briskly, despite a rigid ban and threats of guillotine. Some of the tunes were political, some pornographic, and one had no words at all. Try to pass a law preventing that, she thought. \nThe other company's harlequin was beaten one night in the street, and rocks were thrown through the stage windows. The manager of the rival troupe decided they had had enough, and sold the charter for the theater to Grazano. The money they had received from the Baron was diminishing withs alarming speed. Along with rent for the space, they were also paying numerous bribes to court officials, to try to obtain audience with the Marquis. Still, they continued to perform, adapting their characters, plots, and speeches to the most recent events and tastes of the city, their songs often dropping suspiciously into a more spoken delivery. Several times, they saw spies in the audience, but what, really, could they report?\nFinally, a proclamation was posted, on large parchment nailed to the doors of the theater, that all foreign acting companies were hereby prohibited from speaking, singing, or otherwise communicating in French, Italian, or any other known or unknown language. It seemed the comedians were shut down for good. \n\n~OPERA of INFERIORITY OR THE NEW EDICT OF THE KING\nLombarqo stared at the laughing teeth of the Marquis de Sua, contemplating violence. He had been kept waiting, enduring the contemptuous sneers of the attendants and sycophants, whispering and laughing behind high collars and hands that had never held a shovel much less a sword. The fake-captian's fake pride, of course, was a double-bluff, his ability to honestly mock cowardice coming from the same conviction as he had held when he was a mercenary for Spain: the knowledge that he had killed when necessary. \nThe Marquis de Sua, meanwhile, was explaining the new edict to the Comici Malfamati's Capitano, the pretend/real Spaniard soldier. “It doesn't matter,” Lombarqo was shouting at the Marquis. “We'll have the audience say the lines. We'll paint them on the set. Better yet, they can supply their own!”\n“You don't understand, do you?” The Marquis said. “Have you ever seen the comic opera?” The fake-captain, who back in Bergamo was a weaver and tinker, said that he hadn't, since they couldn't afford the tickets. He looked out the window. The streets were designed to inspire awe by all providing a clear view of the palace with its floating domes and gardened columns. The king's personal bedchamber was the epicenter of descending wealth and power, with courtiers and courtezans from all of Europe clawing for the top. The entire layout of the pleasure-city was meant to offer obeisance to the king.\nThe Marquis tossed four tickets on the costume-covered dressing-table. “Ah yes,” he said. “Your Dottore is in jail.” He took back one of the tickets. “I will tell the concierge to let you in. Also my servant will deliver some clothes. I recommend you wear them.”\nThe rest of the Italian players had received similar invitations, and showed up, they were hilariously informed, equally dressed in last year's fashions. They were then treated to a symphony, several speeches, and the arrival of a handful the king's attendants and ministers accompanied by sitting and standing repeatedly. The entire stage was floating above the Seine, along with the balcony and box seats. A string of torches and their reflections led to the refurnished chateau. The scenery was a series of urboreal marvels, with actors ascending and descending on turtles and winged dragons, dressed scantily as rapturous dieties. The history of the empire and the royal bloodline were presented in heroic meter. \nIn the following week they introduced a series of performances where they re-enacted, without speaking, the pompous and overstated gestures of the french commedians, wearing masks adapted to provide grotesque replications of the leading actors' physiognomies. The huge floating stage-sets were replaced by Pasqueza the clown, carrying the other actors on her back. The Lazzi of the Bow was repeated several different times, the routine where a character is forced to bend over until they fall on their heads. The comparison with the Sun King's court was obvious. \nThe french comedians bribed guards to burn down their theater. They escaped, but their notebooks of lazzi were destroyed, along with the book Grazano had been writing. \n~\n\nAs the comedians were picking through the ashes and rubble of what had been their theater, they failed to notice a splendid six-horse carriage pull up on the opposite side of the street. The wheels of the carriage didn't touch the ground. It was made of ur-wood. A liveried attendent jumped down from the front of the carriage, tying up the horses and pulling a step-ladder from the undercarriage. An old, rather corpulent man stepped down, a mole on the side of his nose. \n“What a shame,” he said in refined french. “I myself would have liked to see the famous daughter of Tomolo perform. Still, perhaps it is best a hovel such as this burned down.”\nGrazano turned at the voice, and while the man was talking he took in the well-groomed horses, the servants, and the floating and finely painted carriage. He bowed deeply. \n“His highness has indeed been merciful to let our humble stage stand as long as it did in the shadow of his munificence.”\n“Ah,” the man said, looking down through his mustaches, and fingering the pommel of his sword. “This theater was yours, then.”\n“Yes. My name is Grazano Baldoaro. We are the Comici Malfamati, or the Infamous Commedians. My role is that of the pedant doctor. This is our zanni, Rosla, and our Capitano. And may I present to you Lucrezia Tomolo, daughter of the famous Harlequin.”\n“And I,” the short man said, looking Lucrezia up and down, “an the Marquis de Lelouch. Please, step into my carriage. I would very much like to hear of your adventures, and offer you any assistance I can.”\n\n~ \nThe fact that the so-called Sun King had amassed inconceivable riches, Rosla thought, did nothing to change the fact that he was a fat little toad. She stalked unnoticed through the pools and gardens, past the small army of sychophants and attendants, working through the night. \nIt was like a play, she though, on the scale of a civilization: a nightmare fantasy that gripped a self-hating world. As much as she hated the taboos and heirarchies of the Roma camps, she saw how their endless motion kept symbolic centers from taking root. There was a limit to how low they would ever bow.\nShe entered into a side-door from one of the atriums, moving through the unlit halls of the mansion, searching for something worth stealing.\nGrowing up, she remembered her caravan being approached by well-dressed and impolite men who demanded to know who their leader was. Someone would be pointed out, one of the older gypsies, and hours would be spent in serious negotiation, over hunting rights, or paying tribute, or some such business. Later, when they broke whatever agreement they had reached, and were again approached by well-dressed and impolite men, they would claim another man was their leader. It usually took these men several visits before they realized that they were receiving a different answer every time, and that the Roma had no leader. One month a well-respected elder might claim to by a king of all gypsies everywhere, with the seeming consent of the governed, only to have the title pass to a distant cousin the following week. At any given time there might be a dozen, or a hundred, kings among the gypsies.\nThe Roma were shunned and despised wherever they went, but that was how they ensured their freedom. Invisible, they were left alone. \nA small vase, painted with bands of birds flying in opposite directions, wings alternately pointed up or down, had caught her eyes. She stood before the small niche in which it was placed, lost in thought.\nAfter the Marquis had taken them from the burnt-out theater to his floating estate, the comedians' fates had changed. He had become their patron, and in the past few weeks she had seen more wealth and comfort than she had dreamed possible. \nThe performances, too, had changed. They had free reign to mock whomever they wished, especially the enemies and rivals of the Marquis. Access to inner circles of court gossip made their performances even more relevant and well-attended. The only price, she thought, was their dignity and freedom. She had watched with disgust how Lucrezia especially had bent her will to please the Marquis. They had become nothing more than jesters and spies, gradually becoming less human, taken over by the desire to climb, to become more visible, more elevated in the eyes of the court. All religions, societies, and courts, she thought, demanded the same thing: affirmation of something patently untrue. The more complete and ridiculous the falsehood, the more complicit the victims became. \n“Do you like it?” asked a voice from behind her. It was the Marquis, his face flushed from drinking, his sword hanging by his well-muscled legs. He was in his forties, but rumored to still be deadly in the duels the nobility were so fond of. His voice was like the blade leaving its scabbard. \n“I was thinking of stealing it,” she answered. Often the easiest place to hide was the truth.\nThe Marquis bowed. “Please,” he said, “it is yours.\n“If you are giving it to me,” she said, “I don't want it. The only pleasure is in taking without permission.”\n“I couldn't agree more,” he said, and too late Rosla realized she had walked into his trap, noticing the erection pointing out of his brightly-colored tights. She tried to run, but he grabbed her by the hair, pushing her against the wall. \n“Please,” she said, using the excuse that would have been sure to stop an advance among her own taboo-fearing people, “I am bleeding. It is the wrong time of the month.”\n“I don't mind getting blood on my sword,” the old Marquis said, grinning, his breath reeking of wine. It was the thing she had promised herself she would never let happen again. She thought of Ginqualo, his sad dying eyes as she offered herself to him, giving for the first time what so many men had taken by force or paid for. This time, she thought, as the Marquis raked his fingers up her thigh, lifting her skirt, she would exact a greater price.\n\nPerformance\nThe performance was scheduled to take place in a month, to coincide with the Sun King's departure for Paris. The chateau of the Marquis, floating above the beggars and markets on the street, was still dwarfed and shaded by the magisterial palace. One of the ball-rooms had been converted into a theater, with a space for an orchestra, and the traditional layout for a commedia stage, a shared courtyard flanked by the two-storied facades of Dottore and Pantalone's houses. The Duke insisted on his own son playing the role of the lover, suggesting that Rosla take off the costume of the clown and play opposite the awkward young man. Lucietta would wear the mask of the Harlequin, performing the Lazzi of the balcony that proved fatal for her famous father. \nThe Marquis spared no expense trying to rival the productions of the french comedians. He had elaborate stage machinery constructed, buying a boat made from an ur-tree able to float above the stage. The background was a huge window of delicately stained glass. The representation was an allegorical portrait of the courtier and his various gifts arrayed along compass points. \nThe son was an idiot, and Rosla, after being raped by the Marquis, had been told that she must now entertain at nights his repulsive offspring. Lucietta had done nothing when she told her what had happened. The Marquis also insisted that they work from a script, so that it could be approved of before hand, despite the Doctor and Lombarqo's warnings that this would drain all humor from the play. Rosla extracted from his son information about all the nobles who would be in attendance. As the performance approached, she watched the sky nervously for signs of rain. \nCHAPTER 12: AGE OF THE ICE APES II\n\nIce apes spent much of their lives swinging from vines, calculating how to direct their weight and centrifugal motion to where they needed to land. Their fingers and arms grew strong and their reflexes keen, tuned to the precise shifts and timing needed to safely complete acrobatic leaps. Even the odd embrace Or8o and Efsun found themselves in, combining their bodies into a singular pendulum first dropping and then driving them upward out over the cold and misty void, was familiar. In terms of physicality and sex they were closer to Bonobos (from your dimension) than chimpanzees, and often clumped together for ease of travel, climbing on one another's backs or using one another's ankles as a way to extend the reach or snap of a swing between trees. \nDespite all this, regardless of how many times Or8o may have rehearsed, at a smaller scale, the stunt they were now attempting, the ape was terrified, his heart beating fast against Efsun's chest that was pressed close to his. Efsun had warned him of the psychological effect from the huge mass of apergenetic vegetation, but Or8o had never felt anything like the psychic force that now assailed him, even as they passed through the outer edges of its aura. \nEfsun had timed her grapple well. The island was moving downriver with impressive speed, tilted in the direction of its movement, so they actually swung around the the rocky spikes and loops of knotted roots on the underside of the land-mass, the downward gravity of the trees adding to their angle and speed. If the momentum hadn't been enough to carry them close enough to grab onto one of the precarious hand-holds they were aiming for, and the vine swung back to hang straight, above the cold waters of the river, Or8o wasn't sure they would have the strength to climb up it, fighting against the downward push of the roots' reversed gravity. \nEfsun took hold of one of the dangling bridges that had recently been cut, and Or8o felt a wrench as the vines went taut, which, had they not been nearing the end of their original arc, would have torn them free. As it was, they spun dizzyingly on the axis of this new chord, as the bone ape took a few deep breaths before beginning to ascend. \nOr8o had never been this near a large up-root grove before, and the mind-silence terrified him. He let go of Efsun's body, where his hands had been gripping the thick hair of her back, and clung to the cut bridge of tangled blood-vine. Efsun, weighed down by her bulky shoulder-plate, had hard time reaching the uncertain ledge. \n“This is terrible,” Or8o tried to think to her as she reached down and took his paw in hers, pulling her up, their eyes meeting through her mask. \n“I know,” she thought back, the images of her words barely perceptible over the droning of the trees. On their feet, they had to scrabble around the edges of the island, overflowing with ferns, before they could find an entrance. Sections of the path seemed ripped away from when the Island left the valley. They found an entrance, finally, by tracing the source of a stream of water tumbling over the edge, up to a small tunnel. Inside, it was damp and warm. Efsun loaded her sling, and readied the antler-spike that had been tied into her fur. \n“I've never trusted you,” Or8o thought-screamed, barely broadcasting over the white noise of the roots, before they enveloped their minds completely. It was impossible to think to one another after that. As they went farther into the tunnel, water dripping from the ceiling, the telepathic noise seemed to switch, for Or8o, into an absence, a mental silence he had never experienced before. Always, he had walked in a dual world, consisting of both the physical and the paints and sounds of cognitive energies. It was as if all color had suddenly been drained from his surroundings, or as if a second throat he had always hummed with had been suddenly been cut. His world was reduced by half.\nPerhaps because of this sudden tunneling of psychic vision, their sense of smell was stronger, and they noticed sooner what they otherwise might have missed: the scent of blood. It was in the water running under their feet. Unspeaking, the two ice apes exchanged glances. They found the body after a turn in the passage, tangled in some exposed roots, apparently having fallen from a higher ledge. There was a wound in its chest that was unlike either of them had seen before, like that made from an arrow, but one shot with an incredible velocity.\nThere were more corpses farther up, with the same inexplicable wounds. They had been dead for half a day, maybe more. Efsun was pointing to something on the ground, near the now blood-scented stream. Footprints, but of a kind neither of them recognized. Wearing coverings on their feet (which, to them, were still wired to the brain almost as auxiliary hands) was not unheard of for the ice-apes. When crossing long, treeless stretches of frozen Earth they often had to protect the soles of their thickly padded extremities, but such make-shift shoes were usually made of woven grasses, or animal skins tied wrapped with tendon. These prints were made from something different. The imprint was too smooth, too regular, with even, hoof-like shapes on the front and back. There was something wrong, too, with the distance between them, and what they said about the weight of the ape, if it was an ape, that made them. \nThe ground beneath them shifted, the island groaning as something in its internal balance or ballast changed, probably some part of it falling loose and tumbling into the river below. Something in the air smelt foul and strange, an odor that seemed not to belong to the world the ice apes had known before. With an agreement unexpressed with anything but their eyes and bodies, the two ice apes followed the bizarre footprints up toward the surface. At points Efsun had to use her antler-spike to anchor them in the mud, pulling Or8o up behind her. \nThe water leaking through the tunnels and dripping on their heads increased, and before they reached the open air they could hear the sound of rain. They emerged through a tangle of leaves into a nightmare. Even Efsun, with his hatred of the linguists, and conviction of the impending war, recoiled at the signs of indiscriminate slaughter. The entire coven of Waterfall linguists was dead. Some of them had flesh torn in the same manner as the bodies below, ragged holes punched into their pelts, while others had stab-wounds of impossible violence. Efsun had seen, unlike most apes, the knapped stone blades that the taboo-breaking tribes had sharpened in secret caves, evil edges that would cut your finger if you pressed down on them too hard. Even those, though, even the worst and sharpest of them, were nothing compared to the weapons that whoever did this must have used. \nThere had been no signs of storm when they had waited on the branch over the river for the island to come in range, but now dark clouds were dropping angry sheets of precipitation, bursts of electricity crackling overhead. Even more evidence of the unnatural weather that had been gathering over the flying groves, lately more than ever. More evidence that the linguists had broken the taboo, and something had come from the sky to punish them. At least they could walk easier, here, the localized gravity of the trees pushing up instead of down. \nOr8o frantically searched the bodies, bounding between them, looking for TreLa4. One of them, he saw, was a nameless priest, and he yelled in shock as the ape opened his eyes, dropping him back into the leaves. His arm was broken, and his aged forehead wrinkled in pain. He spoke in sounds Or8o couldn't understand. Efsun joined them, trying to communicate in crude gestures with his arm, pointing at the bodies, forming his face, behind the mask, into a question. The priest closed his eyes, then opened them again, never stopping the stream of gibberish from his lips. Finally he put his shaking hands out in front of him, the lower on flat, horizontal, and above it a fist. Then he took the bottom hand away, staring at the tightly closed one that remained. He brought the other paw back, as it had been before. Efsun looked at Or8o, whose features also showed incomprehension. The priest's meaningless noises got louder, and looking back he repeated the gestures, this time with the fist disappearing, and then returning to hover again above the open hand. \n“The island,” Or8o thought, although no one could hear him, “he's saying that the island went away, and then came back. Whatever did this, it wasn't the telepaths. It was something else...” \nRunning\n\nThe sun, bending from the horizon in nearly paralell rays, lit the top halves of the trees in volcanic reds. The warming months and lengthening days had started to press shoots of green out of the ground and from the knuckles of branches. \nThe Mammoths had trampled everything again. The paths along the mountain ridges, punctuated with caves, didn't really have gardens, but there were spots of wild-growing vegetables and roots he had been looking forward to. TreLa4's legs hurt. Her breathing (like her body) was short and heavy. Unlike Te2ao, she was not a runner. For the past three years she had been sedentary, memorizing chants. Finally, she had come to the conclusion that the basic social structure was a result of shared physiology, and that there was no clear distinction between telepaths and linguists. Often rude or insensitive people simply found it advantageous to pretend mental-deafness to the pain they inflicted.\nSupposedly, those chants were what kept the sacred island afloat, and according to the mystics, they were the reason everything—including the politics and language of earlier centuries, had to stay exactly like it was, forever. The words she had repeated again and again ran through her mind. In the distance, focused by the cold, the citadel-grove was a barely visible smear on the horizon.\nThey had come from the mountains, and were headed towards the coast, following trails that ran by the river. Te2ao motioned for a rest, and they ducked behind an upturned boulder, sheltered from the wind and dark sounds of the coming equinox. “It's impossible,” TreLa4 said in words, “we'll never make it.” They had been friends since childhood, TreLa4 could always hear Te2ao's mind more clearly than any others. In the library, though, the elect did all they could never to communicate in anything but speech. They prided themselves of their mental deafness. To admit to mind-reading was to confess low birth. \nThe Scholar-linguists lived under the shade of the oldest ur-trees. The screaming voices of the tree were the only thoughts, outside of her own, mutants like TreLa4 were told she would ever hear. When she left the citadel, she had condemned himself to a muted mental world. She was an outcast, and could no longer call herself a keeper of the stone or tree taboos. The tree-islands had declared sanctions on the water tribes. The entire branch on which TreLa4's family depended would be culled. \nThe bridges and vines had been lifted, preperations made for the journey downriver to the Delta. The root system clung to the rocks like the tentacles of a jelly-fish, pulling boulders up into the air. He had dropped and tumbled bruisedly down through the roots, and spent several days recovering. While the branches and leaves could produce euphoria (and supress telepathy), the roots had the exact opposite effect. TreLa4 had dreams of space, and six-sailed ships that could cross over continuities in time. \nThe vines hadn't reached far enough: she had been forced to fall down into the poisoned pool, and barely made it to the shore. While feverish, she had dreamt of Or8o, the telepath she had left behind to study with the Linguists. She remembered vividly things about the tribe that the Council had decided to destroy. When she woke, she was clear of the shadow. The island, the library of trees, had left the valley for the first time in a hundred years. Stumbling up the mountains, she had met a group of Northerners. Even with her limited ability to read minds, she could feel their waves of intense distrust. She tried to run, but they caught her, and dragged her to the moon gate. If Te2ao hadn't been there, the bone apes might have killed her, while the wild group of runners only watched. With her telepathy gone, they would not have been able to feel her pain, and empathy would not have stopped them.\nTe2ao, though, had fought them off, with a song that even she could feel pressing outward from his mind. He had grown stronger on his travels. “I'm glad,” Te2ao had said when TreLa4 told him how he had escaped the island. “Now we'll go to the Delta together. Don't worry. We'll find him.” Leaving the next morning, Te2ao had noticed the angry stares of a small group bone-tribe telepaths he had come with, Chan2 and Wol3 among them, chains of bear-teeth around their neck. \n“Let's go,” TreLa4 said, wincing at the pain in her legs as she rose out of the wind-break. Te2ao helped her to her feet. \nLike all other hominids at the time, they were short, covered entirely in blue-grey hair except for eyes and palms, with lanky arms and a hunched frame more suited for swinging from trees than for running from predators on the shelterless plains. Simian morhpology, but without the tails. Every year, the forested areas got small, landscapes of grasses and drought-resilient shrubs encroaching generation by generation as temperatures got warmer. Distances were measured by weeks and months of travel. \nThe telepathic and non-telepathic races had just begun to diverge. Physiologically, they were indistinguishable, except for the slightly larger skulls of the Linguists. The thought-mute species' neo-cortical grey matter had began growing slowly to compensate for their lack of direct mental insight into the minds of other apes. \nAlthough the isolation of the Linguists on their elevated ur-tree islands had begun to cause the proto-human inhabitants of Pan-Africa to split into two species, intermediate organisms still existed. There were many songs about the Linguistic wars, when the non-telepathic mutants were hunted mercilessly by all the tribes to near extinction. \nIn the age before the schism, ur-trees had been scattered across the continent, rising and falling. The druids now thought that this ancient population of the anti-gravity fauna had played an essential role in overturning the soil, churning up nutrients buried deep in the rock. The mind-deafness of the Linguists, though, had given them advantage in warfare: they could deceive. In isolation, the other tribes believed, their minds had grown subtle and dark. It was the Linguists that had re-learned how to chip stones into points, and to tie them to the ends of spears. \n“We scare the fire and water tribes,” the original Scholars had claimed, “because our supposed deficiency gives us the right to think for ourselves. Speech is harder to monitor, and harder to control, than irrational mind-images used for manipulation.” They had a point.\nThat was all long ago, back as far as the songs and chants extended. In the end the mutants had taken control of the flying groves, and pulled the bridges up after them. In the following decades they sailed their living arcs of earth across Africa, using the deadly shadows to exact revenge. The smaller groves, or individual trees not under their control, they burnt to the ground.\nWhenever TreLa4 talked about how much better it would have been to be alive before the wars, in the golden age when huge floating trees filled all the forest, Te2ao told her that grand plots of historical time were always false, and progress or decline an illusion. The world was complex enough that tragic and comic arcs were crossing all the time. To Te2ao, ice-apes were probably just as savage then, just as petty-minded and territorial, despite both species' supposed telepathic harmony. Struggles for land and power would always exist, and would always be disguised in rhetoric about advancing civilization, or reclaiming the virtues of the past. \nPeople had long used sounds to decorate their thoughts, but as an ornament only, or to add emphasis and accent to the telepathic message. Slowly, over generations, the sounds became more symbolic, with labial trills and guttural stops, a greater involvement of tongue and teeth. The mutants learned that they could compensate for mind-deafness by adding coded meanings in their wailing yelps. Now, they no longer thought of their telepathic lack as a disability. They considered themselves chosen for some special fate. The telepaths, they believed, were made weak by their mob-like communion. What seemed like a handicap of silence was actually a gift and strength. As individuals, whose thoughts were framed in the labor of sounds, they possessed the key to the next stage of evolution. Their control over the ur-trees grew, along with their military power, and the Linguists claimed this as evidence that they were the rightful rulers of the unenlightened lands below them. \nAfter years of training, surroundd by the mind-mutes, her telepathy was nearly gone. It was no wonder those at the gate of the Sun had shunned her. The things she had learned in the flying grove made her ashamed of what she had become. Like Te2ao, she would forever be running between two worlds, borrowing momentum from one tribe or another, but never coming to rest or finding a home.\n“We should reach the gate of the Moon in a few days,” Te2ao said, repeating the same thing awkwardly out loud, still filled with breath as they walked along. “I know of places we can camp.” Again, TreLa4's eyes were drawn to the distant inverted cone of the floating island, following the ribbon of river through the grass-covered hills. It would reach the shore before them. Te2ao saw where she was looking. “The water tribe are fisher-people, not warriors. Word has spread, and others are gathering, fighters leaving battles in the south. Or8o will be safe.” The last bit he had only thought, and again, TreLa4 was surprised to find that he could hear him. \nThey stopped by a stream to drink, the sound of water tumbling over stones reminding TreLa4 of the sounds she had been forced to make and memorize, the endless mangling of her breath. She was gasping, exhausted, and coughed as the hastily swallowed water went down her throat the wrong direction. Suddenly, Te2ao straightened and grabbed his sharpened walking stick, squinting into the shadows of the trees on the other side of the stream. \n“What is it?” TreLa4 asked in words. Before Te2ao could answer, four of the bone tribe, three men and a woman, emerged from the shadows. They were the group from the gate of the Moon, who had dragged TreLa4 down from the signal fire. After a long pause, Te2ao shook his head. The bone-tribe's thoughts were muffled, unclear, but Te2ao's response came clearly in her mind: “no, Chan2,” he said, “I won't let you take her.”\n\nVisions of the Eldriss\n~Eldriss dreams of Scap\n~Reports of strange killings\n~Island appears\nToo Late\n~TreLa4 and Te2ao arrive, attack underway, nearly killed themselves\n~island explodes/disappears\n\nBOOK THREE\n\n~Sunjac and the Suit\nIt/he was a Sentient, for a moment. It/he was the ship, Zoa, a sea-turtle. A genderless, post-human fragment of the immortal planet-mind. Then it/he remembered he was Lambent, and that he was dead. \nLord Motiv had driven a sword through through his brain. Had Yillah survived? The helmet-crunching severing of his biological self wasn't, grotesquely, the last thing the seed-smugler remembered. He had remained conscious several more seconds, in which he had managed to kill most of the Martian gangsters and cyborgs. Then the crime-lord's yacht had been rocked by strange explosions, and he had fallen into the pseudo-gravity of the ship, blinded, the aperture of his consciousness drawing to a point. \nWhen had Lambent died? When he was sentenced to death on Mars, or when the Guild froze his body and beamed his thoughts, using alien augments, to an anonymous stranger in an identical suit (who, in the case of Lambent's swap, happened to be a highly trained homicidal assasin). Or was it when he accepted the post-human genetic augments? or when he had his skull crushed by the sword? Why should falling to the surface of Earth from several thousand feet prove any more of a finality? \nIt was one of those questions where the edges become harder to define the closer you look. When did the human species go extinct? When exactly did apes become human? When they lost their telepathy? Did the species technically die when post-humans made them obsolete, despite the fact that they were tolerated on the islands above the Earth, provided they never set foot on the surface? Lambent had, though. He had allowed Zoa to make him immune to the Terrestrial poisons, and to give him low-level telepathy in order to be able to interface with the portion of Zoa that would remain on the ship. \nHe should be worried about Sunjac, Lambent thought, although he found it difficult to remember why, apart from his professional lethality. That was the explanation, he realized. He was still conscious because somehow, the suit had switched his mind back into the suit with the assassin's body. That body, though, should be in the Lunar complex, in the custody of the Guild. \nWhere was he now? His thoughts seemed unclear, and was unable to perceive anything about his surroundings except a strong conviction that he was on the ship, Albedo Drift, and something was wrong. \nThat first moment, when he had felt himself as it. He really had been the ship. Somehow, the Albedo Drift had been able to pick up a distant data transfer from the surface and re-integrate the pattern. An image seeped into his brain. The cockpit of the Albedo, darker than it should have been, the bio-luminescence dulled only the basic controls displayed. A muscular figure, SunJac the assasin, slumped unconscious in the piloting chair. The cryo-suit was discarded on the ground where Sunjac had taken it off, but incompletely, for he was still wearing the thick mag-boots, connected to the crumpled suit at the ankles. The bowl-like helmet sat on the controls, lightless. \nThen he was in the suit, his perspective dragged down to floor level, and sensation began to return through the nano-fabrics of the suspension outfit. Experimentally, he twitched his fingers. Somehow, his mind was still inhabiting the cryo-suit, but he was afraid that this ghost-like existence would not last.\nLambent was dead. It was possible that the Guild, somehow, had switched him back into SunJac's suit, but if so, it was too late...the assassin had already taken off the cryo-unit, and without an actual brain to hold his neural patterns, it was only a matter of time before the helmet-copy of his consciousness lost cohesion. \nIt was as if he had no bones. The joints in the suit were pneumatically articulated and the energy cells held some residual charge. Fighting vertigo, Lambent realized what he had to do. His perspective was the camera mounted in the neck of the suit, a back-up of grainy quality. He could see the helmet on Albedo's display table, warping the fluorescent readouts underneath. Two things occurred to Lambent simultaneously: that the bioship was severely damaged, and that the most likely explanation for his continued existence wasn't the cryo-jacket itself, but the Sentient architecture of the Albedo, and the telepathic gene-hack the post-human archeologists had given him on Earth.\nSunJac was slouched over, unconscious. The view from the neck-camera was perpendicular to the floor, but Lambent's problem wasn't with his own body anymore—he had none. His concern was with SunJac's body, or more specifically, his brain. The suit, even with part of Zoa in the engines helping with the integrity of his neural cloud, could only keep his personality and memories intact with a host organ. If he were to continue at all, as himself, he had to put SunJac back in the suit and keep him there, forever. \nAs a biological entity, the ship wasn't flashing with sparks or jolting with shocks (I've seen your world's science fiction films), but with a smoldering, acrid smell, a dimming of the lights, and noise in the telepathic signal. The only real power of movement Lambent maintained was in the fingers. You have to imagine, then, against this backdrop of cannon-blasted bioship, a pair of gloves pulling behind them limp arms and trunk of the biosuit, enormous mag-boots with Sunjac's feet like anchors at the ends. The macabre cybernetic heap, powered by Lambent's dwindling mind, reached the fixture of SunJac's chair, climbing the bone-like back, kinetic charges releasing just enough kick from the shock-joints in the knees to position SunJac's legs so they were forced into the twin tunnels of the empty suit. The hover-racer had the odd sensation of swallowing SunJac (or himself) whole, and he had to pause before the horror of what he was about to do. \nIn that pause, half-enveloped by the cryogenic suit he had just taken off, weak from the drift-cannon blast and the fatigue of the thaw, SunJac snapped into awareness, his augmented brain shunting adrenaline and endorphins into his system. Lambent needed that brain if he was going to live. He had succeeded in getting one of SunJac's hands into a glove, further enabling his control over the jacket. SunJac had been given illegal treatments to streamline the telepathic/cybernetic interface, but so had Lambent. They shuddered in the chair in a psychic battle for control of their shared limbs and body. Lambent won, long enough to send the hand to the shell-like helmet and smash it into the assassin's head, cracking into his nose and skull.\nIn the comic book version of this, the view would show the cockpit from above, the suit how fully on SunJac's unmoving body, sealing itself up. The colors, up until this point, should be nearly monochrome, but even if the comic is poorly drawn you can make the key, morbid detail visible: a splotch of red on the helmet, and a slight crack.13\nWhen the Lunar troops got there, forcing open the airlock, it took an incredibly long time for them to believe that he wasn't SunJac, the dangerous assassin who had killed a guild member and sold secrets to a Martian crime-lord. To Lambent at least, because of the immobilization and mind-blasting, the time the guild soldiers took to believe him seemed incredibly long, almost as long as the period of time necessary to convince them not to let the suit thaw so they could question SunJac himself.\n“Everything you need to know is in SunJac's suit, on the surface of Earth. It has my corpse in it...”\n\nThe Human without Earth\n\n\nThe human found itself alone. Farther from the core of the super-planet than it had ever been. The eco-suit, the biotic shell that contained the simulated ecosystem of the human's home planet, was gone. He had been the last of the actors from the glider inspection had proven to be without cryogenic storage, the inter-stellar troupe of self-hypnotic gurus and improvisational performers who were her reason for leaving the central port. Of course, no one was ever really lost on the starship. The human could have simply followed the planet-suit's trail, but without signaled invitation to follow, it would be a violation of inter-species social mores, if not violation of taboo, to track him down. \nThen the signal changed. The eco-suit, who had walked with the human now for over a thousand years, and come half-way across a starship's core with a mass of a million agglomerated Earth-size worlds, a span of several suns, had left the bio-sphere he had been carrying behind, and found faster means of travel. The human understood the suit's motives. Both of them had been telepathic for most of their travels, and held few secrets. The bio-consciousness had been impatient to get to the edge, or “surface” as he had called it, to find the rest of his crewmates. The suit hadn't really believed they would leave him behind, but slowed down as much as they were by the human's insistence on reincarnating as the same species, every decade that passed he grew more nervous. \nUnsurprisingly, the section of the scenic channel where the suit had decided to seed it's contents, well off the main gravitational chasms, was filled with stacks of rocks. The protoplasic ecosystem the suit had been cultivated for extraordinarily fast initial development, so already there were sizable forests, lakes, even oceans with major ecosystems, adapted to the vertical geography of the channel, with waterfalls tumbling in sheets from one floating shelf to another. The suit had always warned the human that it was just carrying the biotic source-state inside of itself, and hadn't intended for it to be permanent.\nUnder one of the highest stacks of rocks, it found the message: I'll be at the Last Stand Up at the port city of End. Keep checking the archives. Several other travelers were eying him suspiciously, and he began, apologitically, to restack the rocks. It was difficult. The suit had unnaturally keen balance—if he had still been the suit at that point at all, and not some other creature in Earth's evolutionary tree, like a tribe of telepathic apes, or even a Sentient. The human wouldn't have been surprised if the eco-suit had gained enough Karma to gain sentience. His disappearance might have been to spare her the awkwardness of seeing him regain what had once been her own high status in the heirarchy of the ship.\nThe human hiked for several lifetimes in the simulation of Earth, watching it evolve and gradually fill out the patch in the ship's architecture not already claimed by another planetary biosphere restored from the seemingly endless archives of the ship.\nKeep checking the archives. What had the suit meant? The human had been frustrated by the fact that the records in the archives—and therefore the plays about humanity staged by the troupe back in the Core, had all ended when the transposition storms began.\nThe human tried to recall the information about the Sunship from when it had been a swarm of the central escelons, but there was too much it had forgotten in the hundreds of human lives in between. The propulsion of the Continuity was powered by the Drift. The Sunship followed the dimensional tears, drawing from them, making them less severe, saving countless worlds from destruction.\nBut then, the Sunship has to travel on, less it be stranded in the universes through which it must pass in order to harness the Drift. The Continuity would move on, but the numerous points in the chronography they were able to contact they would record in the archives, using it to add to the massive source-memory of the living mega-planet. \nThat couldn't be all, though. The human couldn't be sure but it seemed there was less information in the archives about it's adopted species every time it checked. The mountain and canyon and eventually even oceanscapes around him seemed important, as if the Sunship's memory of them might not always be as keen. \nThe human stayed, ignoring it's original quest to find the actors, and considered letting go. It could do what the suit had done, and abandon the homo sapien genetics for one that could travel more easily through the interstices of the overlapping biosystems and combatible molecular architectures. The suit had often told him that if he really wanted to learn about humans, then he might have to stop being one.That had puzzled him until now, but looking at the landscapes it's body instinctually responded to, the human thrilled at the thought of losing his thoughts in a flock of birds or school of fish. It could, it thought, happily live as beetles for a billion years. \nSomething stopped it. Once, it died with it's leg trapped on a cold mountain pass, and it was tempted to transfer, once the pain finally stopped, into a herd of goats. Something about the curve of their horns, that spiraled ratio, appealed to the human. The ecosystem, the human knew, could support some vegetarian ungulates, and if not, it could become something else. It's mind might finally be freed from these compulsive patterns, wondering what happened to a species whose path the Sunship must have crossed trillions of light years before...It couldn't. When the Sunship asked, it chose human.\nIt had thought there might be others, since humans had been one of the most significant pre-sentient species of Earth, but there weren't any dimensional tourists looking for novel re-enactments of lost ecosystems. Still, the human was the only one of its kind out of the trillions of sentient and pseuo-sentient forms on the ship. \nThe human walked until it died, then again ignored the Sunship's warnings and reincarnated as the same species. There was still the feeling that something was left to understand. After living a few more lifetimes with tribes of flying lizards, who \n-gets freaked out by largeness of ship\n-goes back and gets absorbed by ecosystem.\n\nThen the suit was gone, not only in the sense of having left, but \n\nCHAPTER: INDIRA AND THE SPACE-MAN\n\nIndira, the night after BorQs and Pico left with the telepathic sea turtle, went for a walk. The voices in her head were echoes of newscasters, severed statues of shoulders floating in her subconscious, make-up not hiding the bagged tension under their eyes, darting from multiple, conflicting, teleprompters. \nYazisiz. Spider eyes glowed in the dark. She carried one of their glow-lanterns, charged with daylight, like a wizard from one of BorQs games. She hadn't believed the turtle, Xi, or suspected that she was only telling part of the truth. Now the world was going illiterate. To be one of the few remaining readers, it seemed, would be doomed to always breathe filtered air. The larger island, the air-born peak of the Andes from a zone multiply intangible, loomed beside them, blocking out the stars. \nThere was a time to work, analyzing data, plugging away at samples and lists and tables, always slowed by the static of the technology she was using, and there was a time to turn everything but her basic lenses off, and walk, giving slack back into the mental fan-belts, letting her cognitive engines cool. \nThe Yazisiz virus was spreading across the globe, faster than models of biological epidemics would predict, and the Sentients had to be, somehow, involved. What if they came, not from some parallel world contained in the distributed processors of the cognizant bio-mass, but from a world where humans had, at some point in the past, gone extinct. The fiction of the Biosys origin could be the telepathic animals way of softening the blow. \nInsects landed on branches, unafraid of her wizard-staff, glowing as they were with their own luminescence. She suspected that, were she to dissect them, she would find colonies of the same apergentic bacteria that were living in the samples that Xi had allowed her to take from her fins. The moon was waning just under a quarter full. \nShe heard a noise below her, far off, ambiguous. \nLooking over the crumbling verge of roots and mud wet from rain, she saw an old radiation-suit, the fabric torn and joints stiff, hanging from one of the vines. There was something on its head, or where the head would be, were it not replaced with what looked like a glowing sea-creature, a nautilus shell. Grabbing more securely onto the roots against the wind, she watched the suit swing back and forth, in and out of shadows, like a pendulum. Then it raised one of its arms, and started to climb. Indira screamed.\nWas it possible that the thing on its head was only a helmet? She knew, somehow, it wasn't human. Backing up, she sat on a rock, slightly above the mud, turning the cameras in her lenses on, and waited. The radiation-suit clambered over the edge, saw her, and paused. The shell was a ghostly holographic tissue, with the contours of a human head underneath. \nHe had been built by the Biosys computers, but had scavenged his body from one of the abandoned caches of equipment unearthed by the rising ur-trees. He wasn't an ambassador from the world he had come from, and had shifted to this reality accidentally, while raiding a city that was, in his world, ancient. Indira wasn't sure how she knew that, until she realized that the thing in front of her, whose name was Lambent, was telepathic. \n“Are you human?” she asked. “in your world?” \nI was, the thing answered. Although I lost my classification for illegal augments. My body was frozen in a suit, similar to this one, and my mind transferred. The suit with my body in it was destroyed, but my consciousness stayed in the psychic relay. I'm a parasite, basically, in someone else's brain, whose body is frozen. Who are you?\nLate Night\n“This world isn't our past,” the snail-headed space-suit said. We're not afraid of somehow altering our own history. There are similarities, but no individual historical figures have been found to match between our archives and yours. \n“Then why are you here? Why are the Sentients from your world pretending to be from an artificial, cybernetic one?”\nIndira had brought Lambent back to their nest-like laboratory, hanging from the thick urboreal masses and epiphytes. She hadn't woken Aben, Laoshi, or any of the others, the strange visitor promising not to leave before morning. \n“The Sentients on my world are worried about the instability that seems to coming with the Drift. They are worried that the exiled nations of humans will try to take over Earth with the help of these alternate, past, worlds. There is some reason for them to fear. My hope was that at least some of the humans and sub-sentients that need refuge from Mars and the Moon could find a home in one of the parallel Earths.”\n“Is your world causing the Yazisiz virus?” Indira asked.\n“I don't think so,” Lambent answered from the patched-together version of his Guild suit. “You would expect, when two ecosystems collide, that there would be massive incompatibilities, viruses and immunological mismatches that would wreak havoc in the populations of both worlds. So far, though, that doesn't seem to be happening. Our realities, supposedly separated by thousands of years, seem to share genetic makeup, like they were evolving convergently, invisible to one another but exerting influence...”\n“Do you think that BorQs and Pico traveled to your world? Is the turtle that visited us the same as the Sentient, Zoa?”\n“There is another,” the suit answered. “Sometimes the groves and high-energy cannons send people even farther back, apparently, in history. Around 1681.” \nChapter: Lombarqo Returns\nARGUMENT: \n\nIt had been Lucrezia's idea that they go back to look for the Doctor. Clouds of insects had been flying around their heads, making the fake-captain irritable. Rosla had joined the tribe of gypsies they had met crossing the Alps. The Roma had told them news from Versailles and other places, that the night before (they had felt it?) there had been strange storms, and when the sun rose entire sections of forest had disappeared, in some cases around old monuments and ruins. \nWherever there had been the most life, the traveling women, men, and children told them, that is where the gates had formed. One of the spherical webs of energy had formed around the floating gardens in Versailles, where the private parks had been built around the largest groves of ur-trees. Dottore, Lucrezia argued, might have been freed in the chaos from one of these storms.\nThe draft horses they had been riding were drinking from a stream, and The Captain was trying to get a fire started, the lock and powder-chamber of his rifle laid out on a cloth to dry.\nThe birds seemed particularly loud around them since they had left Rosla and the gypsies. When Lucrezia proposed they return to see what had happened to the Doctor, and if possible to help him escape, Lombarqo had argued against it.\n“I've had dreams,” he said, “and I'm only now starting to remember them. A world that is, I think, the future of ours. One possible future. The world is empty, sealed off, nearly all the humans having sent themselves into the future using some kind of stasis technology. There are...huge robots, from a war that has ended long ago. The humans left alive on this bloodless world, some of them, have become different. Mindless, like victims of the plague.”\n“You've always been a coward,” Lucrezia said. \nChapter: Lambent and the Calvary\n\nLambent, whose physical body had been destroyed, could now never take off his suit, without waking up his enemy, and the man whose brain was his parasitical home. Lately, he had begun to feel less and less human. \nEverything was changing. For all the years he had been in the suit, he had only survived the suffocating film between himself and his perceptions by imagining the day when he would take the helmet off. Now the face behind the mask-plate was the face of the deserter, who had fled the guild contract to sell the data in the Lunar suit to Lord Motiv on Earth. Lambent's brain had been split by a sword, and shriveled by the toxic atmosphere of the once-home planet of his species. \nNow, he was standing on a living bio-computer, a Terrestrial xenoship. There were a lot of relationships, axioms, that he never questioned, until switching place with the man—Orlando—from the alternate reality that seemed to be from his own species' past. Although they were human, the Martian and Lunar colonies never thought of themselves as from Earth, which psychologically had come to represent what was alien and hostile. Some of them even doubted the existence of the planet entirely, thinking it was some kind of a sentient trick, a hologram cast into space. For ten thousand cycles of the moon what was left of the unaugmented, living gene-lines of humanity had, in painfully evident ways, lost control of their own destiny. They had been herded, handled, and put on museums of artificial habitats, like their sky was becoming a half-living museum. \nThe only humans the Sentients allowed on Earth were the rich, corrupt, or cybernetic. Like Lord Motiv, and, recently, like Lambent. Motiv's illegal clone, Ruo, stood next to him, yellow cape flapping in a non-existent wind. Apergenetic fibers had been woven into the cloth, and runes glowed slightly in a sap-shaded green from the underside. So dramatic, the pseudoghost thought, knowing that the clone, spliced with telepathic DNA, could read his mind, as could the living grove around him. The psychic space of the ur-trees themselves was like hot vacuum, part of the network around them but set apart, unstable. \nThey were becoming villains, he realized. Ruo was cloned after one, and neither he nor Breaker were human anymore. Only Yillah was, and she was, again, missing. None of them had any real connection, other than sentimental history, to the species they were about to betray. \nIf you were a Sentient, an individuated cluster of intelligent bio-mass, with distributed synaptics as large as ecosystems, what would you think of humans in the Industrial Age? Slavery had only recently been legally prohibited, and in the case of the States United, coming to the aid, supposedly, of the victims of Empire had gradually turned into opportunistic colonies and exploitative commercial interests. \nLambent had, unlike most of the early drifters, switched consciousness with two different brains from alternate points in the multi-verse. One of them had been a man who had shot his own wife, and who was planning on collaborating with the Martians from his own world, in order to retake the Sentient Earth in the name of humanity. A secret cabal of inter-dimensional robber-barons were already seeking, through their own psychic drifts, an alliance with humans to start a cross-world war (which would later be called the Worlds War) against ice-apes and post-humans. \nThe other, Orlando, was a labor activist, adventurer, and the son of a man who had raped and killed Orlando's mother. “The drifts aren't always with people similar to you,” Lambent had explained to Yillah on Albedo8. They had taken the cock-pit out of the Continuity II and were laying on the poison grass. Yillah had been given a temporary immunity from the toxic plants and atmosphere. The biosphere of earth was not uniform in its opinions towards humans. Some areas, if a ship of unfrozen homo sapiens crashed into their forests, would help them. Others would not. The tribe-mind of the Albedians was a kind of rogue sentience among the consensus species. To them, Lambent and the rest were just more cosmic castaways, pushed through the delicate membranes of being by some unknown and unstoppable force. \nHe had made a deal with this part of the Earth's ecosystem: they had helped him rescue Yillah from the moon, in addition to providing him shelter from Genre and its minions, and now he would serve as their ambassador explorer to the alternate world they had discovered, one where every organism was alone, and incapable of telepathy. A world where humans reigned unquestioned, and poisoned and destroyed the ancient groves. \n“There are certain man-made machines, and men made machine-like in their service. They are like Lord Motiv was,” Lambent told the Sentients when they asked him to go with them through the gate, as a translator, “who will need to be destroyed. I can help you find them. Others, the majority of the species, are blameless. \nLambent glanced at Ruo, who was the same age as his mother, who had given birth to him six months earlier. He had since been impersonating the crime-boss who had been planning on using him as a clone. \nLiving in one of the few human settlements on Earth, Motiv had used a technique learned from the Sentients. Advanced species didn't use technology as such, but they had certain organelles and organism that could be gifted to perform necessary operations. Motiv had paid for these alien devices with human slaves. A human consciousness couldn't be transferred into a clone using drift-worms, but one living consciousness could take over another, forcing a transfer, after which the original body, with the host's mind, could be disposed of. Motiv was going to use Ruo as a puppet in a suicide game. \nThe flying turtle had offered him its back to ride, its thin shell glowing underneath with organs that looked like runes, divided into the sections of a mandala, or octagon. He had climbed on, not without first lying down by way of saddle an old carpet that he carried with him, that he had taken on the Earthward journey to cover the cold metal seat on the ship. Ruo took one of the over-sized birds. Up in the mountain groves there was an area where trees had fallen outward, radially, from a central point. The fragrant pine needles and cones stopped, having been blown backward by a powerful force. Ley-lines of drift energy were visible under the rocky soil, in the same way the the sea-turtles circulation had been visible under its armor. The ground was scorched, causing Lambent to wonder if this might have been an evolutionary strategy on the part of the larger groves, which he saw remain untouched. For the next thousand years they would have an uncontested view of the brightest sun. \nThe turtle, reading his mind, said that nowhere in the living memory of any dimension had these explosions happened before. They met Breaker and Yillah at the gate, riding more of the oddly glowing and floating birds. About a dozen of the still-loyal Genre henchmen were gathered with a small moving network of fauna and shape-shifting sentient plant-tissue. When the sun was directly overhead, a boom like the sound barrier broken exploded directly above them, with a bright absence of any light, and then they were in another grove, this one floating above an ancient city, where there was no forest, only troops laid out in formation, ready for war. \n~Revenge of Malwise\nARGUMENT: Orlando and Malwise both go see Snake Canyon where the Bandits were routed, and Lily had been shot. Malwise tortures Muir, who has drifted with a counterpart. Orlando tracks down one of the bandits, with the help of one of Lily's last manuscripts. \n\nOnly Orlando and the Doctor were left, and Malwise had apparently been driven mad by Merfield and the Blinkertons. Izabella was dead, the Captain was dead, and now the woman they had been traveling to the West coast to meet, Lily Dreadful, had been shot by her own husband. \nFrom what the young activist could piece together from the bookseller, the story was as follows: Muir had hired a sheriff to hunt down the bandit, and suspicious of Lily, had sent a deputy to track her back to the Bandit's hide-out. Lily had hidden around a bend in the canyon, and then killed him with a pistol given to her by the Bandit leader. \nShe warns him of the trap at the Snake Canyon Pass, but the group goes anyway. They are gunned down after being betrayed by one of their own men, and Lily is found, dead, behind one of the bandit masks. \n~Membrane\nThe alien grove appeared on the Sentient earth, an entire ghost structure from the past, when only one species held the biosphere in thrall. Zoa was deep layer of moss and algae, growing in a luxuriant bed toppling over the marshy roots of Ur-trees, when one of her friends, a family of thick-skinned river-mammals, told her about the odd shell, skeletons of trees molded and nailed, and the creatures found inside.\n\nChapter: Age of the Ice apes, act IV\n\nBorqs had been hiking with Pico, bounding in the positive side of the apergenetic distortion. The effect was an order of magnitude greater than anything he had ever experienced. It was what he imagined the moon would be like, or the Martian surface. Higher in the branches, he knew, there were actually zero-gravity patches, with a unique micro-ecology. They had sent some of the bacteria into space and they had reproduced as if made for space travel. Borqs noticed that he no longer heard the old man's steady but light tread behind him, and then that the landscape had changed drastically. Even the sky was different, as if the tint had been adjusted in his lenses. He wasn't wearing his lenses, he realized. He wasn't wearing clothes. \nGrowing up, Borqs had read a lot of science fiction, dating from the 19th through the 22nd century. One thing he had never liked was the endless drama of characters debating what was real, or questioning their own sanity. He was proud, then, of his own reaction when confronted with the fact that he was inhabiting the body of a primate with part of its skull missing. The immesurable size of the floating landmass was a more than a normal clump of biomass. Everything felt different. Even the season had changed, or their location on the globe. It felt like a different planet, although, he realized with astonishment, that could be due to perceiving it through a different brain, as a different species! \nHe had two sets of memories, although that of the nameless priest was more like a set of objects, inert, while his own could still be accessed as living mentation. The priest, who had taken over one of the positions that 8rto had vacated, put himself under the bone knife of the Linguistic surgeons, who had taken out, clumsily, the telepathic region. Supposedly, that explained how he ended up here. Was it the work of the xenians in the bio-computer, or some other phenomena entirely, that both worlds were subject to and neither could control. \nThe merger of consciousnesses, BorQs realized, had been gradual. His name now was the one he had secretly been calling himself in dreams. The ice apes, too, had been working visions of other dimensions into their songs. The scientist in him questioned the uniqueness of this event: if something happened once, it probably had happened many times before in Earth's history. It could explain the glitches in the fossil record when evolution suddenly veered off in a new direction. Recorded history wasn't, relaly, all that long. \nWith an odd, superstitious reversal of logic, BorQs wondered if the ecological crisis on his own world hadn't somehow slid the dimensional dial sideways as an adaptive response, in anticipation of massive die-offs or climate change? Was it a defense mechanism, a kind of retreating to the diffuse static of alternate configurations of reality, looking for a solution? \nThe path was getting harder to see in front of him, and the basin was now starting to fall off into small inclines, the central groves and secondary growth blocking out what little light there was from the stars.\nHe reached the end of the tree-line, arranged in a circle around the central basin. A few shrubs grew, and snakes and lizards lived under rocks. A shadow leapt out at him, threatening him with a sword. The dormant part of his brain understood what was going on—he was a telepath, and was here for revenge. He backed up against a tree, bracing for a killing blow. \n\n~\n\nChapter: Megalopolis, conclusion. \n\nARGUMENT: Te2ao is with Kamala, Borqs' ex-wife. There is an uprising, and Megalopolis is being hacked. Her fiancee, Kutuphan \n\n“Why do you think this is happening?” Kamala asks him. “Who do you think is behind it?”\nTe2ao didn't answer for a while. They were on the second floor of a building facing one of the smaller squares, emptying out as the curfew went into effect. “The technology of this world makes it seem like access to knowledge would increase. In our home dimension, any news would have to travel through many miles and many minds before it spread. Here, Capital entertainment can write a bulletin and billions hear it instantly. We're subjected to “news” on that daily cable ride, and it takes all the pirated software I have to keep the feeds from creeping it. I've been here a week already. So have you. Do you think individuals have more access to what's really going on here or in the tribes?”\n“So this thing's body your in, its brain, doesn't have any ideas about how this might be connected? The virus, dimensional drift, the ice-ape war...”\n“Even when it only involved one dimension, I don't think I ever felt that I could understand politics. Society is simply too interconnected, and there is too much interference with the way people think.”\nTe2ao wondered what these two hairless creatures were doing right now in the ice ape world, and what they were thinking. Would he have his other self's memories when they drifted back?\n\nChapter: Postponement\n\n\nChapter 15: End of the Penny Dreadfuls\n\nPenny was back with her husband, the financier, and almost all of the original bandits had been killed, their heads or other body parts mailed to potential malcontent, or publicly displayed. The stories, meanwhile, had become inter-dimensional best sellers. They taunted the bankers, the rail-way men, with detailed descriptions of their mannerisms and physiognomies, their weak spots and secrets, that the information had to be coming from the inside. \nThen Penny was shot in the raid on snake's ridge canyon. \n\n~Orlando and the Postponement Crawlers\nSaying goodbye to Malwise, Orlando took the road North, past boom towns built from rushes for gold or ur-trees, shabbily built factory homes clustered around mines or railroads, always building, destroying, relentlessly tearing up and plowing the earth. Dust blew mercilessly across drought-emptied farms.\nDark red swaths of desert alternated with tall, primaeval looking forests. The city of Freeride, near the gulch where the outlaws had been hunted down, and Malwise's lover killed, was a lawless, anything-goes outpost for speculators, hunters, and laborers. He spent weeks there, at the Saloons, whore-houses, and work gangs, asking about the band of horse thieves, if any of them had survived. No one would tell him anything, except for a thick-whiskered deputy with a small body and oversized coat, who recommended that he leave before he would up chopped into pieces and fed to the mountain lions. \nThe news that there was, coming along telegraph wires and pony express, seemed impossible to believe: men who had claimed to have traveled between dimensions, into the past or future. Thousands more who claimed to have waking visions of other worlds.\nThe next night, he got into a fistfight, after talking to a thin, sun-burned woman he'd been flirting with more out of boredom than any real interest or intent. The cattle puncher she'd come with called him something he had thought left behind in the South. He was light skinned, and usually kept his hair cut short, but he had let it grow long enough for the kinkiness to show. \nAfterward, he remembered being drug along the street by his shoulders, then waking up in a tee-pee. A man came in through the flap, light blinding 8rto at first, so he couldn't see the man's face, but he was carrying a knife. He cut a fruit, handing some to 8rto. \n“Thank you,” Orlando said, sitting up, fighting waves of nausea and headache. “Are you an Indian?”\n“No,” the man said, and Orlando, seeing his features more clearly, saw that this was true. “My father was a chinese track-layer, and my mother was from the lands the U.S. took from Mexico.”\nHis name was Tecumsu, which had been given to him by the Indians, who had been forced off their homes, like him, by laws favoring white settlers, with the weight of unregulated and racist militias behind them. \n“Why are you looking for the outlaws?” Tecumsu asked.\nOrlando shrugged. “One of my friends knew the woman who was killed. The wife of the banker. She was sending us stories, about the outlaws. My friend, he thought that the bandits might have something to do with the transpositions, the gates to other worlds...You're were one of the bandits, weren't you?”\nTecumsu didn't answer, sucking on the pit of the fruit, then throwing it into a corner. \n“Do you want to see it?” he asked, finally, his thin suggestion of a mustache lifting with a smile. \n“What?” Orlando asked.\n“The other world.”\n~gate \nThey left the following morning. Orlando had slept in the teepee of Tecumsu, who had spent the night out under the stars, next to Joshua trees. The entire village, within hours, had rolled up the animal hides, strapped enormous baskets and pouches onto the backs of their horses, and left the site behind. \nOrlando followed them through chaparral up into the foothills of a mountain. It seemed like the natives weren't even looking at the ground anymore, but sensing something in the air. At one point he saw Tecumsu talking with some of the older Indians, looking back over the horizon. “We are being followed,” he told Orlando when he asked. \nA thin stream poured through a crack between two uninviting precipices. Climbing through them, fearing for his life, Orlando was stunned by a landscape hidden within the canyon that seemed nor to fit with the area outside. Even the air seemed different. \nThey stood in a grove of trees. The sky was a scorched red, and all vegetation disappeared. Shelves of the earth had lifted free from the ground, borne upwards by some impulse to levitation in their mineral composite, testifying to ur-trees that grew there long ago. The band of Indians and outlaws ducked under these shelves, hugging the cliffs as they slid around their edges. The heat surrounding them grew even more intense. Emerging from the shadow of a particularly large rock outcropping, 8rto knew that something had changed.\nThere was an unfamiliar smell in the air, like some kind of spice shipped from far away. He looked around him, and saw with alarm that the landscape was different than it had been moments before.\nThe Indians had stopped, talking among themselves. Tecumsu was grinning.\n“Where are we?” Orlando asked. \n“No one really knows,” the bandit said, tugging his bandana loose from his neck and wiping his forehead. “Some kind of spirit world, according to them,” he gestured at the older tribes-people. “There aren't any other humans here, as far as we can tell. Very few trees, either, and unfortunately little in the way of edible plants. There are animals, and we hunted a few of them...deer and bison, but unlike any that exist in the world we know...”\nOrlando slowly took in the ocher sweep of horizon, the fantastically shaped boulders and plateaus. “This is how you stayed on the run for so long,” Orlando said, understanding flashing over him. Tecumsu nodded.\n“There are gates opening up all over the country. We found this canyon pass following wild horses, that had lured away one of our stallions. The militias could never find us because we had disappeared. There are other gates, farther South. Once we knew what to look for, we found others, although they can be unstable.”\n“It could change everything,” Orlando said. “The wars...”\n“We haven't explored that far from this cluster of gates. That's what this expedition is about: to look for somewhere the tribes can live, to regroup until their forces are strong enough to reclaim their homeland.”\nThey walked farther down the canyon, finding and following a clear stream that,when drank, tasted odd, like burnt maize. Huge flocks of birds, similar to carrier pigeons, flew by over head. Two of the Indians in the lead started talking excitedly, pointing down to the bottom of a tree-lined ravine. \nVERSION A: The next day, they were captured by the band of Blinkerton-paid vigilantes that had followed them through the gate. Larry Bimford, the bounty hunter, shot Tecumsu from his horse. Then the bandits and Indians were surrounded by horses, a dozen riflemen pointing guns at the mostly unarmed and unmounted group. \n“Why did you shoot him?” Orlando asked. His hands were tied behind his back, and was unable to brush off the flies that kept landing on his nose and face. \n“The gates,” the Blinkerton answered, “have to be controlled. Can you imagine the chaos if criminals like you and your Chinaman were able to hop in and out of dimensions?” \nPolitical borders would disappear. Deserters could not be caught. The Indian tribes would have other worlds to run to. \n“Why are you taking us?” Orlando asked. \nThe Blinkerton smiled, pushing up the brim of his hat. The deputy badge flashed reflected sunlight from his chest. “There is a war coming,” he said. “The clash of empires has just expanded to a whole new battlefield. The United States army is going to need all of the fighters it can get. This world,” the deputy waved his sun-burnt hand dismissively, “is worthless. We've been sending scouts through these canyons for months. But there are others, filled with untouched forests, like America before it was discovered by Europeans, when it was only savages like these running half-naked. Except there aren't even Indians. It's empty. Huge floating groves, waiting to be cut, their sediment mined for drift feul.” \nVERSION B:\n“What the hell is that?” Orlando asked when Tecumsu had handed him a dented tube of telescope, taking a Scap of leather off the lens. Through it, Orlando saw a creature that seemed half metal, and half knotted wood and vines. Its shape was human, but with extra joints and impossibly high shoulders. It was lumbering through the ravine, but then stopped, as if sniffing the air, and then folded into a recumbent position, in the shadow of a boulder. \nObeying a command by an old but remarkably tall woman with feathers tied into her hair, Tecumsu and the others approached the creature, drawing flint-lock pistols, hunting rifles, and longbows. They paused, in a cautious semicircle. The machine-thing, glowing with hidden lights, plates of carved wood and other unidentifiable materials sliding along its body like a suit of armor, stood still. Orlando walked up to it, his weapon lowered. “We're humans,” he said, thinking how stupid he must sound. “We're from another world. We're not going to hurt you.”\n“Speak for yourself.” The voice was deep and sneering, its owner stepping out from behind a tree. It was one of the Blinkertons who had been following them since Chicago. Others, he knew, would be waiting in the cliffs, with their rifles trained on them from above. \n\nCHAPTER: Utopian Wasteland\nARGUMENT: Toki travels South from the pole, along with a band of cybernetic warriors and historian shamans. His band of raiders recovers some stasis jars, which they are there to revive. \nThey updated their terrain and biological maps as they went, sending images back to the pole. There were arguments at nights about which direction to go, which was the safest. Some of them wanted to go straight to the known camps, while others were for following trails of game or predators. The landscape went from white and green to burning browns and reds, as they followed canyons and clefts that were left by glaciers Scraping through them in the distant past. \nToki had earned the treatments, the right to walk out doors. It meant that he would never be able to read or write, but it also meant that he could walk in the new ecosystems. He didn't want to study the world from behind screens, either of suits or habitats. \nThey were hunting ghosts. The elders had theories that the crossing of worlds, the visions and transpositions, were caused by the sleeping ancestors. \nThere was very little life on Earth. Once keystone species had kicked out, triggering the ecological collapse and the Postponement, roughly eighty percent of the planet's species had gone extinct. Habitable zones had gotten smaller and smaller, retreating to the poles. The equator became a steaming belt of radioactive deserts. \nThe end of human influence on the ecosystem triggered massive fluctuations in the biomass that hadn't been seen since the two continents of Pangea were rejoined through human immigration. Devastating swarms of insects, huge herds of ungulates. Now, more than 6,000 years since \nToki liked how his society functioned. It was made of consensual, emergent micro-politics, mediated by robotic violence. Here is how it worked: it was taboo to harm another human physically. This was a hold-over from the Bloodless age, before gene treatments had helped to ease the population bottleneck. Another relic was the ritual combat of machines, controlled by a remote magnetic resonance relay, keyed to the cognitive signatures of their controller. \nMecha-golems served as status indicators, as well as a kind of game attendant to debate and the settling of disputes. Often disagreements were on the management of territory, and resource use (especially water). \nToki's golem was a set of glowing spheres along a cord, that he could wear slung over his shoulder when no materials were available. These spheres had spiked extrusions that could be used to bind with other components, like wood or repurposed artifacts from the expansion age. They were, essentially, universal assemblers. \nThe spheres interfaced with the dataclouds, as constantly evolving algorithms for organic and cybernetic assemblages jostled for survival. One of the spheres would, when in proximity of a component it required, exude a small laser pointing towards the object. The miniature drift-reactors inside the spheres could produce enough apergy to animate whatever patchwork mechas that the computer could direct Toki to make. \nTwo dozen of them had left the outpost on the verge of the hot zone, and they had lost only four, three to predators and one to a fall. The party had split into two main forces, one which wanted to proceed to the ruins of the expansion-age cities, and the other which wanted to hunt a kind of dire-wolf that had evolved in the Post-ponement. \nWhen they were forced to chose a path by the spine of a mountain range, they spent several days unable to reach a consensus, and tempers began to flare. A ritual battle-ground began to form, drawn with symbolic lines in the shared meta-space. \n“We should be planting trees,” one of the elder women said, her mech standing behind her, lopsided from a half-complete transformation after one of their raids on one of the old-Earth sites. There was a battle, first only with the principal antagonists, others joining in when the first conflict proved inconclusive. \nToki's golem came out well, having opted for a minimalistic structure of joints between carved pieces of wood, hardened through chemical and thermal processes. For some reason the artificial intielligence algorithms in Toki's processors was doing a better job improvising with the kind of materials they were encountering. \nHe had stood on the margins for most of the fight, joining only when he had a chance to see the other mechs in action, analyzing their movements and weaknesses. He had challenged one of 7ogtek's supporters, letting him in for a clasp before disemboweling the robot along one of its hidden seams. Then he had held his own against 7ogtek himself, deflecting his blows with afterthoughts of armor he had grafted onto the golems limbs, long enough for a mass of the opposing party to take out his legs, forcing him to accept defeat. \nThat night, the councilwoman Bala had come into his tent and given him a small capsule of drift-feul, along with pieces of robotics, bone, or wood that the defeated warriors had to surrender. \n7Ogtek paid more attention to Toki after the battle, which had both positive and negative effects. He spent long hours training with his new parts, to be able to defend them in the inevitable challenges. Ritual combat through golems was a natural expansion of the Polar North's politics, as a kind of more enlightened substitute for the more barbaric instinct of physical violence. At the same time it settled disputes, it also fueled evolution of the technological phyla. \nThe farther South they traveled, the more intense the Sun became, an enormous sphere of shimmering flame. In a valley ringed by squat trees, the cliff carved with ancient glyphs, they came across a group of humans. They followed them for a while, trying to determine where, or when, they were from.\n~Toki and Orlando Speak\nThe weapons of the industrial-age humans had been taken away, the fungus-covered humanoids confiscating with distaste the crude gun-powder tubes. The Blinkertons' hands were tied with hempen rope. Orlando, the outlaws, and the Indians walked among the golems and the utopians. \nA young woman served as a translator. She was a “ghost,” she explained, one of the humans from ancient Earth who had sent herself into the future as a cryogenic head. Her accent was strange, and she paused over many of the words that Orlando used. Her name was Aza. \n~GHOSTS, GOLEMS, and ZOMBIES\n\nThe mind, no matter what else happened to the body, couldn't stop entirely. The long tape of neurological signals making up a coherent experience of identity couldn't be cut; there had to be a continuity. During the postponement, the heads floating in buried jars, crawling around in mobile servitors, machines meant for automated survival, the consciousnesses were kept wrapped in a cloud of Theta waves, collectively dreaming. \nIf you want to think of the entire novel as this soup of slurred cryogenic vision, meant to keep hibernating humans sane, you are welcome to. There are several characters who might believe they inhabit the frame—the meta-narrative that contains the others, but as the narrator, I can tell you that all of them are wrong, even myself. \nBroca had been born in XXXX, and was part of one of the mass time migrations from Megalopolis. Their boundary conditions (when the time-nomads would be reconstructed from their bodiless state) had been set as a group, so they would, whenever they woke, have companions. Postponements had been getting long enough that often, when they came back, there was no one living who spoke the sleeper's langauge. They were called ghosts. The ground was filled with them, although not quite as many as the revivalists' legends claimed. The process had never been cheap, and many of the servitors had broken or run out of power, the brains within them warming to a useless pulp, the minds within going dark. \nAs a solution to the food and water crises of the post-expanison age, when the Earth couldn't sustain the huge populations that drift-feuled agriculture had produced, it was preferable to starvation, and was mostly voluntary. It was better, many thought, to fall asleep with hopes of their lives becoming one day reknitted to a world unravaged by humanity's mistakes.\nShe had been revived four times before, during the Bloodless age, when the battling factions of the lunar and Martian colonies (governing through a still-literate class of masked clerics on Earth). The population of the planet, not counting the ghosts, had dropped to 800 million. Large swaths of the globe had been turned into uninhabitable desert, or reclaimed wilderness. \nBroca didn't remember when she had woken up this last time. It seemed that it was years ago, that she had been moving through a landscape, hungry, uncertain of his location and history. There were parts of Megalopolis still encased in the hermetic layer of bio-shielding, but others were ruins. She couldn't read the signs she found, even when carved or painted clearly.\nVaguely, she remembered a virus, the technicians who decapitated her telling her that it might be their last chance, with so few left on Earth who could read. Then there had been the wars, when she had lived underground, controlling giant machines in her mind, fighting for Union in the bloodless war. \nIn a surviving pane of polished metal she saw her reflection. Pale blue skin, with scars and unhealing wounds on the legs and arms. Her mouth slack, saliva encrusted in the corners, her hair a tangled mess of dreadlocks. How did she get here? What had she been eating? The memories surfaced, reluctantly, of months wandering alone, scrounging in dirt, eating animals she had found dead, after scaring off vultures and brushing them clean of insects. \nThe next moment of consciousness came later, when she was seeing herself again, but not through a reflection. She was naked, with black, blood-crusted wounds showing through the filth. Her hair was longer, down to the small of her back. Her eyes were bloodshot, the expression in them revealing nothing other than fear and confusion. There was another person, like her, a man holding a stone in his hand. It was he who was looking at her, and she was seeing herself through his mind, and knew he was going to swing the rock at her head before his hand started moving. \nShe jumped backward, swiveling into a slow, shambling run. The degeneration of her body made her slow, but she could still move faster than the man, his hair like hers except with a bald stripe on the front and top, the exposed scalp weeping with scabs and sores. He moved hunched over, his hands swinging back and forth. Instinctively, she looked around for any trees that she could climb. A branch came off in her hand, and obeying a far-off logic, she turned with the heavy stick in her hand, somewhat awkward with knobs growths, and waited for the man to come to her. He fell quickly, and after a few more swings his limbs stopped jerking. Watching the blood, she felt hungry, and tried tearing the flesh off bone with her fingers. \nSpitting out the flesh, she paused, a slightly higher level of cognition prompting her to take an additional step, although it made her head hurt to try and pull the dim intuition out of her ruined grey matter, like gristle from her teeth. Fire. She needed to make fire.\n\nCHAPTER: COMMEDIA REVENGE\n\n\nLombarqo felt that something was going to happen. It was in the air—an unseasonable chill. This was how he used to feel before a battle, when he had been a mercenary for the Piedmontese. Every scene in which he played the Capitano, the braggart soldier, drew force and inspiration from how much he hated who he had been, and his ignorance over what war would really be like. Every ridiculous line he uttered, and foolish figure he cut on stage, was an atonement for his pride.\nBefore Lucrezia's father had died, in the Comici Malfamati, he had played the inamorato, the lover. Whenever he thought of those days, he was forced to admit that the company, since they had accepted the Marquis as their patron, had lost their integrity. They were little more, he thought bitterly, than a superflous tribute to the noble's vanity, so he could tell his friends that he and his son had once performed with the once-famous troupe of the great Tomolo. Lucrezia, however, seemed unaware or untroubled by their new position, won over by the fortune and opulence that she had sought, unsuccessfully, in Venice. The trappings of their troupe had acquired new glamor, while their soul, he thought bitterly, had faded. \nGrazano, at least, had made token protests to the Marquis' suggestions. Working from a script, he had explained, would rob the performances of the spontaneity that gave them life, their ability to react to the audience, to change their tact based on the feel and mood of every show. They could not compete with the French theater, Grazano argued slyly, for subtlety or grace, and depriving the commedia of its crudeness and vulgarity would simply turn it into an inferior version of the erudite comedies already filling the playhouses. The Marquis would smile, and explain that in order to stage a performance on the scale he had in mind, a script must be submitted to the official censors months in advance for their approval. His son, he argued, had his heart set on acting with the troupe, and the Marquis was afraid that he would not be able to keep up with their banter. \n“Besides,” he said, “your French leaves much to be desired. With a script, memorization will obviate the embarassment your lack of proficiency might otherwise incite.”\nLombarqo, mournfully going over in his mind the pedestrian dialogue the Marquis had penned, took out his sword, as he always did before performances. It calmed his nervousness, and allowed him to get into character. Odd, he thought. The blade was sharp—he was sure that he had dulled it, as he always did before a play. He took a few swings, sticking out his lips and straightening his back, practicing the leg-work of the Capitano, who moved as if his lower body were a horse over which he had little control.\nHe, Rosla, and the moronic offspring of the Marquis were in a small curtained area next to enormous window at the back of the ballroom, with a dramatic view of the main aveneu de Paris, with its ascending steps of menageries, parks, pools splashing with waterfalls, and of course the great floating palace itself. A fog was rolling in from the surrounding forested hills, creeping up the sides of the plateau on which the city was situated. Lucrezia and Grazano were waiting in costume on the stage itself, which was hovering above them, ropes keeping it secured to the exquisitely tiled floor. It had been made of the highest quality ur-tree timber, and the apergenetic field shimmered, displacing motes of dust and plumes of tobacco smoke. The room itself was well-suited for a theater, shorter than average, with a balcony extending out from the upper floors. A chandelier, filled with candles, had been suspended from the high stuccoed ceiling, adding to the light provided by the lanterns on the walls. \nThe actors had had supper in a separate chamber, and had dressed and prepared while the servants cleared the dishes from the nobles meal, which had consisted, based on the trays they had seen being carried back and forth, of innumerable courses of roasted flesh, puddings, soups, and tarts, and caraffe after caraffe of dark red wine. Lombarqo, reminded of the flask he kept in his shirt, under the Spanish breastplate of dented steel that, along with his plumed helmet, made up his costume, barely had time to take a drink before the Marquis was announcing the beginning of the first act. He watched as two of the Marquis' lackeys grabbed the ropes and walked towards the wall, a simple system of pulleys guiding the slow descent of the stage. They tied off the ropes before the stage had fully touched the ground, the apergy underneath forming a cushion of energy, key to many of the painful-looking falls and stunts they would perform. On the stage itself, the force pushing upwards from the planks would help Lucrezia and Rosla with their tumbling acrobatics. Two more attendants, dressed almost as ridiculously as the actors, used another set of chords to pull off the curtain that had been concealing the stage, the thick folds hanging from the front boards to puddle on the floor, so that the audience would be unable to see their entrances and exits by ladder and trap-door. \nAs the curtain was pulled from the two intricately carved panels, representing two houses on either side of the stage, Lucrezia was revealed in the patched costume and grotesque mask of the Arlecchina, the audience applauded. They had feasted and drank, and were ready to laugh at anything. The scene began with the lazzi of the sleeping harlequin. As the applause died down a cacophonous snoring was heard, impossible in volume. Grazano entered, in the long black robes of the Dottore, and woke the harlequin with a series of nudges, kicks and slaps. He then proceeded to give her instructions regarded the preparation of the wedding for his daughter, Flaminia, and Orlando, the son of the wealthy Pantaloon. As he was speaking the harlequin again fell asleep, dropping to the floor when the doctor's back was turned. Dottore, turning, tripped over her. She didn't wake up, and the snoring began again, to the delight of the audience. The doctor woke her with blows of his cane, dragging her to her feet, and the business was repeated. Each time the harlequin fell asleep in more and more improbable positions, ending by snoring on her feet, with her eyes open. This time, when the doctor woke her with blows, she was startled out of her wits, and began beating the doctor, using the wooden batte that was the harlequin's trademark. Dottore, screaming and stumbling over the hem of his robes, ran off the stage.\n~\n\nIt was going well, although the polite applause was noticeably different than the raucous calls and cheering they were used to from fair-grounds and cheap play houses. The next scene featured The Marquis de Lalouche and his bumbling son, playing Pantaloon and the lover Orlando. It didn't go as well. The rest of the company tried to cover up the bad acting with loud music, while Rosla, costumed as the servant Brighella, performed acrobatic stunts in the background, pretending to spy on their conversation. The apergenetic field of the stage was stronger than that of the cart they had traveled with through Europe, allowing for aerial turns and balancing that would have been otherwise impossible. \nThe plot was typical. Lombarqo was playing twin Capitanos, returning from adventures abroad, which provided opportunities for comic misunderstandings and slapstick beatings. The Capitano was in love with Harlequina, which was easy for Lombarqo, reflecting as it did his real emotions for Lucrezia. The rest of the plot revolved around the marriage of the innamorati, the lovers, and their parents, the vecchi, Pantaloon and Dottore. The zanni, or servants, initiated various sub-plots, subterfuges and complications. Whenever the performance lagged, contrary to the instructions of the Marquis, they resorted to irrelevant bits of pantomime typical of the commedia. Through the mask of Pantaloon, the Marquis glared at them, despite the obvious success of the comic business with the audience. Rosla played both Brighella and Flaminia, quickly and expertly slipping in and out of costumes behind the screens or drop-curtains.\nFinally, the cue came for the lazzi of the balcony. As Brighella, incensed at the Harlquin's interference, Rosla was supposed to chase Lucrezia out of the stage-window onto the precarious balcony. As she leapt, the audience held their breath, releasing it only as she gracefully grabbed the railing and hoisted herself onto it, the thin slippers of the costume allowing her toes to grip the polished wood like a balance beam. Passing the boxes filled with Counts, Countesses, Dukes, and Duchesses, she would pause to bow and offer her compliments, improvising based on their dress or appearance. Each time, she bowed lower, her rear end sticking out over the edge, always seeming to be on the verge of falling. In the middle, she did somersaults, stood on her hands, and was preparing to take a final bow, when there came, from outside the hall, an odd sound like the chitinous cry of insects. The attention of the courtezans and courtiers watching the show was drawn to the large rear window behind the stage. The fog had risen to engulf the chateau, and strange lights like will-o-the-wisps were flashing in its depths. For a moment, time seemed to slow into a viscous humor. Gravity, already lessened by the ur-tree gardens of the estate, seemed to disappear. The world seemed to float, anticipating some event, the emergence of forces or energies usually obscure.\nAll at once, once side of the ballroom dropped, with a hideous lurch and tilting, the chandelier swinging wildly, casting rogue shadows on the walls. Amid the screams, Lucrezia lost her balance and fell.\n~Aza\n\nAza grabbed the ankle of the woman as she toppled from the balcony. Two sets of memories, two identities, jostled in her brain. It was as if she had been playing a character, and the part became more real than the actress. In one, her father had sent her into the future as a head floating in a cryogenic jar. In the other, she was a Roma, a musican, and a tumbler. She was both an actress of a decadent court, and a trained soldier in a cybernetic war. \nHer limbs pulsed with the capability of violence. Still holding Lucrezia by the ankle, she looked down at the stage and recognized the man who had raped her, fittingly costumed as a lecherous miser. She saw, too, his idiot son, staring up at them with a gaping fish-like mouth. The chateau tumbled downward again, the other side now uppermost, and Aza/Rosla swung the harlequin up onto the laps of a startled family of near-royals. Men and women were already getting to their feet, stumbling as the room again spun violently, as if the floating manorial island itself were drunk, reeling in the fog. The stage-end of the ball-room was again much lower than the other, chairs and candelabras sliding and clattering with the declivity. \n“Get to the stage,” Aza said to Lucrezia in a language she hadn't known before. She took several steps backward, and running, leapt from the balcony. Her landing, cushioned by the apergy of the stage, the impact still sending a booming echo through the chamber. The ropes held the platform in place, but it rocked and buckled, the two vertical fronts rocking dangerously against their braces. “Your son,” Aza shouted to the startled Marquis, “cannot marry Flaminia. You, Pantaloon, with your wretched lusts, have already violated her honor.” This, Aza knew, was what the woman whose body she now possessed had been planning. She took off the green mask of Brighella, and seeing the madness in her eyes, the Marquis stepped back. Lombarqo made his way towards her, also watching Lucrezia, as she walked, more cautiously now, along the upper tier. “Stop,” he said to Aza, putting his hand on her shoulder. With one motion, she spun away from Lombarqo's grip, grabbing his sword, and stabbing the Marquis's son through the chest. He collapsed, his expression of stunned incomprehension barely changing as his life bled onto the stage. \n“This is the price for her innocence!” Aza shouted, the memories of the young gypsy flashing through her mind.\nThe Marquis, overcoming his shock, his face red with rage under the mask of Pantaloon, drew his own sword and charged her, but was stopped by Lombarqo. As they struggled, several lackeys of the Marquis rushed the stage, grabbing Grazano, who was the slowest to react. Hands struggled to lay ahold of his thin frame through the voluminous robes. The chateau see-sawed again, the stage straining against its ropes. Grazano looked up to see one of the vertical panels of the stage, representing the Dottore's house, falling on top of him. Instinctively, he tried to shield himself with his arms, but they were being held by the Marquis' men, so he could only close his eyes, expecting to die as the heavy stage-set collapsed. There was a tremendous crash, and the grips were loosened. \nRaising his eyelids, he saw that the descending wall had crushed the men to either side. He had been spared by the window. \n“Get the ropes!” Lucrezia called to him, clambering down the still-standing wall of the stage from the upper balcony, which was rocking as unsteadily as its twin.\nLombarqo, still wearing his Capitano mask with the enormous nose, was rolling on the floor with the equally masked Marquis, hands around one anothers' throats in a fight oddly evocative of the comic slapstick they had been performing minutes before. \n“Get off of me, you peasant!” the Marquis roared.\n“You,” Lombarqo growled, “are a terrible actor.” Swiveling, he brought an elbow across the other man's chin, just as the chateau tilted again, drastically, in the other direction. Lombarqo used the opportunity to work his legs between them. Rolling back on his shoulders, he kicked, sending the Marquis sailing through the air to crash through the window at the back of the room, his screams diminishing with distance. The cold fog began to leak through the broken panes of delicately stained glass. \n“Hold on!” Aza shouted, using Lombarqo's sword to cut the ropes holding the stage to the floor. The floating platform spun, one side smashing through the remaining glass of the window, protruding out over the grounds below, the broken body of the Marquis splayed in the courtyard. Aza was dangling in the air, her arm bleeding, still holding the rope. The chord on the other side was severed, and the angle of the floor was enough to cause the stage to slide out through the window, held in place only by the remaining upright panel, its window looking back into the brightly lit chateau and its panicking occupants. Finally, as the estate of the dead Marquis bucked and dropped still farther to the earth, the stage pulled free, sailing out into the fog and night. \nLombarqo reached over the edge and pulled Aza up onto the planks. Lucrezia, kneeling, was holding onto one of the broken posts, looking down at the body of the Marquis through the fog. “Grazano!” Lombarqo shouted, pulling off his mask. “The doctor! Where is he?!”\n\n~Dottore\nThe actors went to see their dying Dottore, passing him bread, wine, and water through the bars, she told him about the last performance they had given, and how their stage had been burned. The old fake-doctor asked about the masks. She assured him they were safe, along with all the costumes. The late summer sun played through the residue of recent rains, that had washed the streets of the worst of their slime and ash. \nTheir last play had been, like most of them, a mockery of the court, but had retold a folk legend familiar enough to be acted without words. In the legend, the ancient titans knew that they couldn't defeat the newer gods in battle, and it was only a matter of time before they rose against their creators. They were clever builders, and made a mountain the exact height of the newer god's ability to climb. Had it been any shorter, they would have succeeded and moved on to something else, and any taller would have discouraged them with its obvious impossibility. The fact that the mountain was exactly the right height meant that the dieties couldn't resist it, and were drawn like moths to a flame. \nThe court, Lucrezia and the others had realized, was a mountain whose summit would always be just beyond attainable distance. They were brought to Versaille to make the French feel superior, so they could flatten them with the weight of the flying city's prodigious opulence and shadow.\n“We have to get back to Italy by the winter,” Lucrezia said, leaning her back against the prison so she wouldn't have to see the wreckage of her friend behind the barred gutter of a window. “We're going to leave. I'm not sure when, but we'll come back. When the king is surrounded by a different circle of idiots we'll try again to get you out.” The doctor was too weak to answer.\n“Before we go,” Lombarqo said, “we're going to do one last performance.” The three of them stood and put their masks on. Turning their backs on the floating palace, the street, and the setting sun, they faced the tiny window of the dungeon and started the play they had been rehearsing.\n\nCHAPTER ZZZ: Another Bridge\n\nTreLa4 waited for 8rto to climb back up. Their carrier birds had been traded, but what had real value was the rope, which had now been hanging from the ring in the hand of the kneeling statue for three days. Could 8rto have been hanging from the rope for that long? The weight of the cord was now greater than the weight of her lover, so she couldn't tell he was still there or had found some kind of surface. \nSeveral times she had to menace men with a sword, to prevent them from stealing the rope. They would kill her for it, she almost telepathically knew. Why didn't they just wait for the trees to grow back? The bridge, a living thing, better knew how to repair itself than them. \nThe inhabitants, though, the constant pilgrims of the span, felt that they had to move. The current cosmology was one of downward spirals, supposedly worked out by disinclinations of the sun and moon, recorded by astronomers at the beginning and end of their life. The majority of the bridge-dwellers, illiterate, suspected this knowledge, as they did any that seemed to originate in books. \nEarly in the morning on the fourth day, 8rto threw his arms over the side. TreLa4 nearly stabbed them, thinking she saw being attacked again. The forearms were roughed by the rope, beaded with blood. She clung to them, and pulled 8rto back through the window into the moon-gate library. He laughed drily, and then thankfully drank water that she gave him. \n“There's another bridge,” he said, watching her face as it bravely took the news. “Running North-South.” She told him about the bandits trying to steal their rope. They couldn't drop down together, she reasoned, because someone would start hauling up the tensile chord as fast as they could climb down. When the theives saw what was causing the extra weight, they would probably cut she and 8rto off, letting them fall to their deaths, either on the bridge he had found or one below. \nSince he had left the temple where TreLa4 had found him as a scribe, he had been carrying a finely-worked and painted clay pot, baked and glazed according to some ancient formula. It was worth more than their carrier birds had been. \n8rto offered this as a prize to those who would fight him in a duel. As the sun climbed across the sky he won all of the challenges, but as it fell he eventually lost to a brigand who gave his name as Efsun. The duel had been with unsharpened staves, and the older traveler's was carved with runes. He was literate, and 8rto asked him if he recognized the kneeling soldier from any scrolls he had ever seen. Efsun, a long-runner impatient to continue his journey, squinted at the giant stone carving and said no. \n“Tied to it is twice what the pot is worth in rope. Wait here, guard it, for one day, and then the chord is yours as well. The runner's eyes lit up in an expression 8rto recognized. Not greed, but impatience. Efsun would sell the rope to the builders, making a profit and hastening his departure. The question was, would he wait the alotted time, or double-cross the two young lovers? \nEfsun inspected the rope, testing its weight. “One day,” he said.\nAs the sun rose below them, as soon as it was out of their eyes enough not to blind them as they tied the knots and harnesses. \n\nGravity \n\nOr8o and TreLa4 climbed down from the East and West running bridge to a larger one running North and South. There was a greater frequency of mutations and transpositions, and they had to sleep longer at night, and had stranger dreams. A year later and they found another statue, holding another ring. There was a group of musicians playing near it, hawking the crowd. One of the older ones alternated between singing and selling patent medicines.\n“Do you know what is below us?” TreLa4 asked one of them, a girl banging on a small but deceptively loud drum. She stopped playing, leaving a hole in the music that reminded Or8o of when they came to the gap in the bridge, a long space of silence that threatened them with gravity. The other musicians kept playing, but noticing the change in mood shifted to a different, more subtle melody in a time signature that was hard to determine. The patent medicine seller leaned close to him, and as he spoke, Or8o noticed that he was missing several teeth. \n“Turtles,” the old man said, wiggling his eyebrows, “all the way...” \nThere were more bridges after that, however, even larger and farther down. So many that the two lovers suspected that the entire planet was a network of them, like a ball of string. There started to be more plant-life, though, as if the vines crawling up the sides were more firmly rooted. The air-beasts were larger.\nThe bridge world became striped with layered shadows, forms moving slowly in non-intersecting lines. The lower they got, the more worlds seemed to be collapsed into a single reality: there were space-men, ice-apes, zombies, humans in historical costumes. None of them able to speak coherently as to the history of their world, prior to the great construction. All, however, had some myth that explained why their reality or explanation was the true one, and all of the others mere ephemera and delusion. When they asked an inhabitant what they thought lay below, they would shrug. “Shit,” they might say. “All the different levels throw their shit over the edge. It has to end up somewhere. \nTo the lovers, though, it was both foundation and furnace they were looking for, both the setting and the rising sun. The bridge world was a construct, TrerLa4 now thought, a way of creating a gateway between dimensions. The indeterminacy of the surface was what made the commingled histories possible. \n8rto had known about the Drift, on the East-West running world, but down on the perpendicular bridge, the drift was already a history hundreds of years old. \n\n\nYazisiz, continued\n\nAfter the behavior of the shuttle-driver, the passengers were subdued and resentful. By taking such a strong position of leadership, the ex-security officer, or whoever he was, had made them all feel less secure on this alien world. Ida had finally begun to think of this Earth, on the other side of whatever storm had wrenched them through, as alien. It resembled, perhaps, the past of her dimension, but it had finally sunk in that the resemblances were superficial. \nThe majority of the passengers had finally come around to the view that they were in a past-like world, not the futuristic one her son-in-law had described. She knew enough to know that if they were still alive, they hadn't ended up on the sentient planet. Besides, none of the animals here seemed especially intelligent. Likewise, they knew they weren't in the ice-ape forests that some of them had dreamed about. \nThey weren't allowed to set up their tent far from the shuttle, but Ida and Evrim had gone as far away as Mr. Olgreb would tolerate, and talked softly. They had decided not to make any fires, so their evening meal had been dried fruits and stale nut-bars. Nothing, really, had been decided. The bus-shuttle was going to run out of gas, soon, and besides the landscape was barely navigable. They were following a goat-path, with the thorny branches of berry bushes by the road clutching evidence of the passing of the wooly quadrapeds. They could either set out on foot in the morning, as a group or in smaller teams, or take the shuttle back the way they came. In the end, the ad-hoc conference of the exhausted and terrified passengers had turned into a referendum on Mr. Olgreb's authority. It had been settled, temporarily, in his favor, but they still hadn't been able to make any definite plans.\nThe only humans they had seen since the night of the storm were those wearing clothes from, according to her guess, 600 years ago. Her husband had figured their language as well might be circa the 1600s. Give or take a century, it was still pretty dangerous territory. How would 17th century Europeans react to 23rd century vehicles. They had about the same amount of anti-gravity before the Renaissance, in terms of raw output, as her own “advanced” nations before the collapse, but it was more primitive.\n“There was a town back there,” Ida said, with her back to forest. Evrim watched for anything that might attack from the trees, while Ida kept her eye on how close the driver and the others were. \n“The only way we're going to get back to our Earth is by finding one of the islands.” It was the argument he had made during the meeting, all two dozen of them crammed into the small shell of the shuttle's cab, half of its softly luminescent display useless, showing absence of satellite tracking grid. He explained that even if he had been wrong, and they weren't on the post-human world of bio-sentient immortals, they should still try to get to the centers of the anti-gravity fields. Ida hadn't liked the idea of trying to fight her way into the guarded palace of some prince of a floating city-state, but she saw his point: it would be worse to run out of drift feul in the middle of nowhere.\nThe sun set, and the trees, so unlike the gene-parks of her world, grew even more mysterious and dark. The noises of various scales of biotic light crackled under the bright stars. “What if we don't worry about getting back?” She asked. \nEvrim frowned. Nearly everyone else was asleep, now, small solar charges marking the caccoons of a few still rummaging through their few belongings, or, like them, muttering gossip or assurances. “These people aren't going to survive here...” Evrim said, pushing his lenses up on the bridge of his hose. \n“Not them,” Ida said. “Us. Just us. We are in another dimension. Not in our dreams or some kind of psychic mind-swap, but our shuttle actually went through...whatever that was.” In her mind, she saw again the rent in the tarmac, the line in the sky like aurora borealis, but rippling with plumes of static vertigo. “We have seen something beautiful. After we thought our lives were over. Another adventure. A story, that we are telling, since we can no longer write it down.” \nEvrim smiled. They had both wondered at how their conversational skills had been improving, unsure if it was really the illiteracy, or the fact that they had more to talk about, with the fabric of the universe unraveling. She wished that she could see his face more clearly. The moon was just beyond full, but the leaves and clouds blocked much of its light. The air was so cool here, and the smells more colorful, with all the pollens and microbial life that had been baked off in the ecocide. \n\"I have an idea,\" Ida said. She and Evrim were nearing sleep, their bio-rhythms winding down in practiced synchrony. \"We get up early, before everyone else, and walk to the town we saw earlier.\"\n\"They would kill us,\" Evrim said.\n\"We are going to die anyway,\" Ida said. \"And at least we would know. All the rumors, about who these people are. You could try to speak to them. You said that you could understand what they were saying, yes?\"\n\"I suppose,\" Evrim mumbled.\n\n~ End \nI thought that by working my way upstream to the moment the Drift happened, I could finally understand my own past, the patchwork costume of programs, species, and identities that I was rooted in. Of course, the myth of the starship being somehow primary, somehow causal, turned out to be just as illusory as any of the other dimensions' claims that they were responsible for the Drift. I began to suspect that there never would be a frame that encompassed all the others, or that could be used as a key to understand why the inter-dimensional transpositions began. \nI'm more or less a mask that exists between the dimension of the footnotes—whatever they will be, or whatever other paratextual annotations might be added to accommodate the “real” dimension or dimensions of authorship—and the continuities of the novel. By necessity, the entity narrating the events of the drift would have to be a little mad, and a little pedantic, like the quack-doctors of the fairs and crossroads. Maybe I've always wanted to be too many things, and live in too many worlds, which is why I'm drawn to the gates between realities. \nThe port city of End was positioned at the isthmus to a surface sea. Once I had taken a hover-carrier out of the corridor leading to the center of the star-ship planet, the appearance of an artificial vessel vanished, as the green and blue sphere spilled out on all sides. Cities of narrow overlaid densities hung on gravity-reversing stilts, riots of vegetation blowing under dome-covered wind.\nSmaller boats would rise out of the portal from the sea, docking with the massive space-farers. Terrestrial ships, too, sailed the corridors connecting the six gates from the starship's interior. Bridges rose on impossibly delicate struts high into the atmosphere, trailing tendrils of aerial trees and apergenetic vines. \nThe shift into the humanoid suit, with a portable slush of ecosystem inside, was possible because my journey had an analogue: he had been trying to reach the outside of the ship, somewhere he could see the full slew of stars. Like all of my incarnations, the suit was mostly information. \nI hadn't seen a human on the starship for a thousand light-years. I was just a memory of the species, reduced to the lossy medium of digital algorithms that survived the crunch. I wouldn't know where to begin petitioning for a license to incarnate an extinct pseudo-sentient species. The archive simulations were sufficient for research purposes, anyway, and there was no way I could justify the expense for my own curiosity.\nNothing dramatic or spectacular happened, although I remember things seeming more vivid than they had been. It was the stars, I think, that I hadn't seen for so long. There was the satellite beacon, a kind of miniature moon. \nTreLa4 and the zombie never found the troupe of actors, and the secret to surviving deep space without cryogenic sleep, how to pass time without going insane. They suspected that it had something to do with telling stories, long epics that stretched out to fill the space of a never-ending bridge. A novel, anyway, can never really be entertainment, unless there is some hope of influencing the way that it is told.\nThe final performance or chapter, in the city of End, is a point that I have reached many times, only to end back in the primeval forest, the rituals in stone spirals at the Delta, where the river licked the ocean. In other words: I finish writing, but have only started writing. There are always more layers, what I thought was ink becoming pencil, becoming after-images or proto-images, that have to be chipped away or painted before the hidden narrative emerges.\nThe show, the narrative event, conclusion, that TreLa4 found was not the same as the one she had followed from the core libraries, where she had once lived a comfortable life as a sentient cluster of an insect swarm, it was comprised of different actors, and a bizarre and convoluted plot. The only actor from the original company, aside from myself, was the woman with two mouths. The juggler with six arms had disappeared. The sauroid was also there, but without the cybertnetic symbiot to provide his crab-like arms. \nIt felt, though, like the close of a cycle, and a swinging open of the next. The singer with two mouths took TreLa4 and BorQs, the next morning, on a boat out to one of the sinks, where the surface sea poured, in a tiered waterfall, into the gravity wells that connected to the main axis. I wasn't there, but they thought it to me afterwards. TreLa4 remembered her ice-ape identity, when she had decided to leave the floating sanctuary, and escape the valley of the Linguists. \nBorQs had been on the island in that universe, too, as one of the nameless priests who had carved out part of their own brain in order to cut themselves off, completely, from the telepathic tribe. TreLa4 thought to the woman with two mouths how the feeling on the surface of the starship was like that which she remembered from climbing over the lip of the floating island, from the roots up into the trunk and branches. \n“Yes,” the two-mouthed woman answered. “Above, the stories are multiform, as they are below. Only at places like the port of End does a unity exist. You can remember all or most of the forms you have taken.”\nI understand why everyone recommends going top-side every few millenia. Most of the inhabitants structure was derived from terrestrial, planet-bound species, and living in the interior, without logical orientation or gravity, always induced a feeling of mild claustrophobia, clipping the wings of dreaming. It was good to see the sea and sky. \nTreLa4 was gone, with the zombie, BorQs, was in one of the up-stream dimensions, trying to fight the hegemonic meta-governments from taking over more worlds. I met some Sentients who had just arrived from a hundred-year cruise. They had taken one of the cheaper flights, without any cryonic equipment. They told me stories polished in meteor clouds and long winter vacuums. Gossip from the alien blooms, and scenery only visible through dark-matter lenses. \nWe laughed a lot, fellow travelers, glad to be able to ride the great tides felt by all perceptive life. It seemed like at last we were lined up along some axis, some cosmic direction we could extrapolate into larger realms. \nCHAPTER: OBEY\nOrlando had always had a vague sense that the government, or society at large, wasn't on his side. The way that his world reacted to the Drift reaffirmed that. Travel through the gate was becoming increasingly restricted, after the initial strategy of denying what was happening proved ineffective. At first the world leaders had believed that a new age of imperialism had dawned, with even greater scope for their ambitions, but these dreams were dismissed by glimpses into the wasteland of the Postponement. \nExtra-dimensionals were being taken into custody, and the thousands of exiles who were now trapped on the wrong side of a gate were being denied their chance of making it back. Meanwhile, the continual cognitive transfer, the memories of other identities, continued to lead to greater knowledge of what was really going on, and greater outrage on all the worlds involved.\nInter-dimensional alliances were formed, with a goal of increasing equality and peace, with the mandate of the majority of sentient beings in all dimensions. Spiritualists and politicians alike were embracing the new energies and trying to turn them to their advantage, while bankers and elites were trying to rework the new system into another version of the status quo. There were riots in New York, Chicago, and all along the West Coast.\nDemonstrators, unarmed, in major cities in the Industrial dimension (which dated itself as 1892, according to their monotheistic calendar), were attacked. The shocking thing wasn't the violence, which Orlando, and others native to the world expected, but the form in which the attack came, a coordinated assault with technologies and powers from a number of dimensions. \nTheir nervous systems were stunned with mass-cannons from the bloodless age, while post-human birds and augmented zombie telepaths did crowd control, occasionally bludgeoning or pecking at eyes or kneecaps. Expressionless space suits from the Lunar guild assaulted them with jellyfish spears. The resistance and revolution had begun to mobilize across dimensions, and so the counter-revolution had done the same. \nThat night, in the make-shift prisons converted from hospitals and lyceums, the humans who were taken communicated across earth along cybernetic channels. Some passed physically through tertiary or quaternary gates unknown to the interdimensional Blinkertons. \nOne of the indicators, they saw, of the level of tyranny inherent in a power structure, was by watching how these structures reacted to the Drift. Conspiracies, cover-ups, and draconian attempts at censorship seemed to be the norm. \n\n~Drop\nAll the worlds that had recently been connected by gates experienced a sudden change in the output of their drift feul. Ships veered out of the sky, hover-sleds smahsed, and buildings collapsed. Forests underneath the floating groves were smashed. \nGenre wins, and the anti-gravitational engines become cheap tricks of fantasy, hanging on thin wires of plot device. \n\nBOOK FOUR: CONTINUE \n\n~Placeholder: BorQs thinking of Kamala_3_X\nBorQs was impatient with the practicalities of cleaning the meal, as he had been with preparing it. The world below them could change at any moment, an entirely new vista leaping in to replace everything they had known, and mundane tasks like peeling carrots and whatever unidentifiable root they consumed seemed incongrous, and unbefitting to the enormity of the moment.\nHe had to force himself to recreate the game-space in his mind, creating scrolls and screens that were detached from the immediate physicality of existing. It was, he knew now, like the ice ape backdrops of telepathy. It was hard to image in the pattern of things could be sufficiently contained in the warp or woof of one small group of displaced inter-dimensionals. \nAs a narrator, I don't find this strange at all, feeling nothing more than the natural draw of the smallest detail, calling out to be acknowledged as the bearer of a cryptically condensed imprint, a con-man molecule or monad with pretensions of universailty. The path lies before me, as plainly as a sentence, as the flat geographies of Mars.\nBorQs imagined Kamala with him, rehearsing their conversations in his mind. In the same way that dreams processed the day's detritus into condensed format, interoperable between autonomic and conscious brain function, the imaginary interviews BorQs held with various people in his life seemed a necessary half-way point to incorporating flashes of remembered dialogue into an overall model of a person, such as his wife.\nIt was stupid, their reason for not being together. I don't even remember exactly what it was, except that I felt like the story needed some reason for them to be seperated, other than geography. Some parallel to the difficulties in meeting one another, an emotional distance that had to be bridged, in the same way as the distance between Peru and Tibet, sea level and the highest mountains in the world.\nHere is the page, if it were a comic book: some kind of symmetrical and yet pseudo-arbitrary arrangement of panels, alternating between small and large like some kind of meta-code tapped out by mariners, with one ear to a headset, alternating currents. Don't imagine that, because it isn't part of the comic book page, just the idea behind the proportions of the panels. In the same way, this novel has incredibly long, bloated paragraphs and chapters, as if the prose is a snake trying to digest some particularly impalatable prey. Again, that's not part of the image. The comic book page, with its dot-dash-dash-dot of panels, would show BorQs, in some kind of a picturesque courtyard, with the stars above him. Did I leave out the fact that it was night? This high in the mountains, though, it seemed always to be night. They were always in the shadow of one of the shelves of the accordian-like temples, held together by bridges of twined together roots. One of the panels, not the first (which portrays a pensive, melancholy yet resolute BorQs at medim distance) is a nearly microscopic detail of the peculiar and unmistakably bark, with its creased rivultets, and mauvish, zombie-colored interior. The next, larger panel, would show BorQ's figure from the back. This view provides an opportunity to draw the mountians, with the fog implied by the absence of continuation of the ink lines, lacunae in rendering that emphasises the altitude. \n~Ida and Evrim Escape the City 3_X\n\n“There is a symmetry to it,” Ida said. “the relationships within a world are reflected at a larger scale. The universes at war internally when the Drift happened are now at war with one another.” This included, Evrim knew she was thinking, their own.\nIda and Evrim are one of the stories in the novel that ends happily. This is a comic novel after all, although comic in a sense refers to pictures, prehistoric paintings on the red rocks of a cliff. For example: the two aged but unstooped academics in a world that can no longer read, on a hill, eating from an unfurled blanket. \nAnd stretching. Drifting between worlds made them realize how sore their bones and muscles were, how they had forgotten the most human act of walking. They hitchiked when they could, traveling once they were out of the city with a large man who didn't speak English.\nThe radio was tuned in, with some modification, to ultra-low wave stations that he claimed, by use of hand signals, to be able to tune into signals from beyond the drift. He nodded his head, tracing subtle sine waves as his unreliable looking air-craft made impossible turns, lifts, and landings, using only solar sails. \nMaybe I've said this before, and shouldn't dwell on it, but the islander's driving (he looked to Ida and Evrim to be from the Pacific) was beautiful. The drop, the drain, really was fraud, ecological theft, at a multi-dimensional scale. None of the inhabitants of the six worlds would ever know the cause of the apergenetic lights of the world dimming, as if the planets themselves were dying. After it had happened the old couple had felt that so little of their world was worth saving. \nIda and Evrim had been hiking, exchanging dreams in the morning with traveling partners they had found, one of many pairs or groups that would set pace with them for a while, and then take some different turning, speed up, or stay behind. They were high up, looking down over the city, managing to function despite mass illiteracy. There was a sound like a volcano, thunderstorm, or nuclear bomb, and the glowing lines of apergy that had begun to glow beneath the earth went dark. An entire side of the mountain opposite to where the were hiking seemed to be ripped by some invisible force upwards. The ur-trees moved by some unheard imperative North. Their sleep that night was troubled, the branches overhead threatening and menacing them from the summer sky.\nSince then, they had seemed to grow tired of one another's company, something that only happened every decade or so, and then briefly. The driver, steering with graceful economy of motion, hummed along to the music. Army planes dug trenches in the clouds far above them. The islander was steering them on abandoned hover-tracks, far above the clogged navigation lanes below them, layers of traffic suddenly flattened to two dimensions. \nMany people had died in the crash, before the planet's reserves recovered, pumping drift-blood back through the arteries keeping the world afloat. It wasn't as if the fuel of the world had been drained, but that it had somehow ceased to work as it should have. \nThe piloting of the islander, whose name was Efsun, brought hope back into their world.\n~Tent City_2_X\nThey met two teenagers, who said their names were Shandu and Te2ao. They were musicians with hover-boards, and asked Efsun if he could let them attack their tow-lines to his truck. Efsun agreed.\nTe2ao and Shandu were also knowledge gamers, hipster yuppies in a world where there was no material wealth for success to translate into. The gates, supposedly, were making the world more unpredictable, more prone to random attacks and violence from either aliens or any population of the late 17th century. The tattooed couple felt that the new ideas, and now actual animals and people, flashing between dimensions, were in the end, going to make their own world open and more safe.\nIf there was a villain universe, everyone in Efsun's hover-truck agreed, it was their own world, which had militarized its borders, sent spies, and tortured prisoners. Their earth, compared to either that of 1679 or the post-humans, was a kind of hell-scape—a petro-chemical wasteland redeemed only by a thin cybernetic veneer that was now eroding, becoming illegible after the virus. Now that we've reached the fourth part of the novel, I don't my telling you: my view isn't entirely cynical. The Drop, which destroyed many of the remaining expansion-era architecture, left natural apergenetic species intact, stronger than before.\nThe hover-track that Efsun had been piloting on, the bulk of the hover-truck balancing on the thin rail like an overweight tight-rope walker, now crumbled down into the trees, and after one last burst where he tilted the rudders downwards, catching a natural breeze breathing down the mountainside, he had launched and landed them in a valley below. It was nearing night, so they made camp, listening to Efsun's long-range radio.\nEfsun, who hadn't spoken for the week they had been with him, suddenly said hello to everyone. “I was drifting,” he explained. Ice-apes, when they had been transposed into a human mind, could sometimes communicate verbally, and sometimes not, depending on how much access the two identities had to one another's memories and aptitudes. They were sitting around a campfire, something that was increasingly common in all their lives: meals cooked over coals, unwashed clothing, the endless furling and unfurling of tents, clearing branches, driving in stakes. Traffic swung by on the road above them, scanning them with shadows. \n“We've drifted, too,” Ida told the disoriented looking ex-hover-truck driver. “Have you wondered why it is,” she asked, “that we all, when this started almost a year ago, everyone on this world had visions of the deep prehistoric past, and now, it is one of the only dimensions we can't reach through one of the gates.”\n“I don't think that's true,” Shandu said, looking at her scroll, Te2ao looking over her shoulder. “There are gates from the ice-ape world, in South America, Africa, and in the mountains near Tibet, that go to dimensions we can't access from here.”\n“There are other gates,” Efsun said, his voice even lower than what the group had been expecting from his girth. “I went through one of them, into a year they marked as 1892.”\n“Oh no,” Ida said, thinking of history.\nEfsun laughed, longer than normal for a human, as if the laughter itself were language. “In the ice-ape dimension I am a kind of warrior. We came through in Egypt, which was internally divided between Imperialist influence from Britain, and their vassalage to the Ottomans. We met other humans, though, from an even more distant future (though not as far as that of the post-human Sentients), where Earth's cities were preserved under untold millennia of ruin. There were..” he lauged again, “zombies. And robots.”\n“The Slow Down,” Te2ao said. “In their continuity, the ecological crisis remains unsolved, and because of the Yasizis virus and other compounding problems most of the human race auto-decapitates themselves within 6,000 years, in the hopes of seeing a brighter future.”\n“We're going to use the zombies and the cyborgs,” Efsun said, grinning. “We can control them telepathically. The 19th century humans defeated us at Cairo. Next time, we are going to bring the fight to them.” \n~Solstice\nWe have to have some way of measuring time, Te2ao thought to Shandu. History had ended, and although humans thought that ice-apes had no memory the equivalanet to print or cyborgs, their mnemonic scales were at least as accurate as any of the other dimensions' archives. Now, for all the worlds, a new chronology had begun, running perpendicular to the history that the six worlds shared, or would have shared.\nA year ago they had been on this same journey, going to the solstice gathering at the moon gate, shivering in anticipation of things they felt were coming but couldn't see. Since then, the ape tribes had been in a new war with the humans, who had taken the side of the Linguists in the conflict against the telepaths. The telepathic tribes, however, weren't about to accept the inevitability of their extinction, any more than the humans accepted their replacement by the Sentients. \nTe2ao and Shandu had been together, in various drifts and dimensions, for the past cycle of the Earth around the Sun, but they had recently been reunited in their ice-ape forms. In this dimension, Shandu had been with Wolftree in the battle against the humans. Efsun's warriors, Shandu and Wolftree among them, had fled into the Bloodless Age future, learning that they could control the cybernetic mecha-chassis and zombies of the Slow Down using telepathy. That had been the weapon they had needed, and with a new army from a technological and creature-haunted world, the ice-apes had invaded the descendents of the Linguists on their home dimension. \nThe huge trees around them had bases burnt by numerous fires, some that flared thousands of years before. There was a feul underneath them that the humans craved, that they were willing to die for, risking their own populations, destroying their own version of the planet-mind. \nTreLa4 and 8rto were to meet them at the gate near the mountain pass. They, too, had been traveling between worlds. The ice-ape world, all of the worlds, were being reshaped into new configurations. Now, rather than Linguist and Telepath, it was those who followed Continuity and those who worshipped Drift. Always, the forces wanting to conquer and assimilate a world would first stoke the differences and animosities already smoldering, playing one side of a false division against another. Nature, around them, argued against the linear and binary. The only thing for plants and animate matter was balance and light, love of life and fear of death. The moon was up, and the air filled with dragonflies. \nWolf tree joined their fire after the sun had set. He was carrying some kind of beast on a stick, gutted. “It's Genre,” he said. “It will be good to eat.” \n\n~Final Stage\nWhen the goal that we have assigned as the pole-star of our desires and wishful destinies is comfortably, perpetually, out of reach, we tend to give little thought as to how we would handle the eventuality of actually achieving it. Lucrezia never imagined actually having the gaze of an audience as attentive and comprehending as she remembered those who watched the gambols of her father. That recognition was as distant and unreachable as stars. Even had she become a professional actress in Venuto, self-doubt would have always prevented her from believing her own acting equal to the tradition. Now though, performing for a sky filled with sentient animals from another world, and humans from three different dimensions, even that ambition seemed irrelevant and small. \nThings, finally, had gotten to the point where she had to admit that her life, and whether or not she succeeded on the stage, had never really mattered. Nor would they. As a narrative algorithm, I know the temptation to turn stories into epics that exaggerate the importance of individual characters. The entire multi-verse, in some versions of Drift narratives, hinges upon the speech or actions of a single hero—usually because the aggressor from one dimension sees into the heart of a sentient being from another—and there is some truth to such reductive parables. The psychic transpositions played as much of a part in preventing all-out war between the linked realities as the physical storms threatened to make them inevitable, each dimension blaming the other for destruction that was, at first, entirely uncontrollable.\nThe Sentients had found one of the most stable of groves, high in the Himalayas, in order to meet, and hold one of the first inter-dimensional councils. The city, too, was isolated enough that no matter what dimension they drifted too, they would not be attacked. My goal was to use them to convince the Sentient ambassadors, should they show up, not to destroy the worlds they were suddenly linked to, and to give them the cure to the Illiteracy virus. Eventually, humans from the outer colonies might migrate through the islands onto the older Earths. If the pre-industrial world the Captain came from was to be saved from Borq's starving, collapsing civilization, then it would probably be up to the Sentients to intervene, and I was going to be their ambassador.\nAt one point in the negotiations another humanoid stood up and challenged Ruo and I as imposters. He was right. On the other hand, my advantage was that the Sentients relied on my translation in order to understand anything the humans said. If it weren't for the protection of the ur-tree grove, I would be driven mad, with my zombie splices, by the mental keening of the huge, whale-like ambassadors. \nWhen Borqs spoke, the clouds of beetle swarms and chattering birds seemed especially aligned to his voice, and my broadcasting, in the langauge of micro-bacterial feeds and chemical exchanges that were symbols to the Sentient biosphere. “More than anything,” the information-ecologist began, “I am curious. I want to know, if it is true there is a past in your continuity that corresponds to the present in mine, how my world got to where you are now. It is a shock, of course, knowing that we are no longer the...dominant...species. That we are exiled, and those who are allowed to live on Earth can't leave the floating groves, and aren't allowed to read or write. Not that I can't understand why.”\nMaybe I do tend to exaggerate the importance of that night, but in terms of this novel, as a coherent set of patterns and lines of development, our stories were then fused together. To us, to me, the performances seemed terribly important. Humanity, I think, made a good case for itself. Again, though, the entire meaning, if there is one, of the drift, was a recognition of the complexity in the multiverse, and how curved lines of causality can become. For most of the characters in this account, I have directly experienced their minds and mental lenses. In one way or another, I can write with some authority as to what it was like to be them. Their memories are now growing alongside my own, trying to make sense of the new connections and emergent patterns. We all, in our inner chambers, drape the figures that we play in the regalia of heroic splendours. On that stage, in a living city made for a post-human Earth, that remote Himalayan forest, with the Sentients listening to my translated message, rippling with it as a bio-luminescent sea,(and, we would later learn, adding instant annotation that it would take humans years to read and understand, once literacy had been restored), it seemed like we were the focal point of some enormous struggle.\nWhat it was, of course, was a confusion of interiority and exteriority. It felt that we were important, and changing the environment around us, but really this was only the way our identity perceived its place in an entirely knew and previously hidden universe. Our realities were being demolished, and in the inevitable egotism of the mortal self, we were deluded into thinking it was our own will responsible, or at least guiding, the destruction. \nThere isn't any pattern, in my opinion, to be found in the drift, no logic to the transpositions of self and remote forests. Maybe there was a momentary analogue of emotion, or attitude, when the energies from the fault lines between worlds trembled, that drew one mind or continuity of experience to another. Another view, which I also reject, is that in the same way that the temperature changes from various worlds seemed deliberately arranged to cancel one another out, so to were the psychic mirroring meant to reveal something matching a profound polar resonance that was pitched precisely to cause a spiritual or intellectual shift, or awakening. \n\n~Sentient\n\nIt was unpleasant for a Sentient to drift into human form. That might have been where so much of their dislike of the species came from, and why things had gone so badly in conflicts between Sentients and humans. To be without telepathy, in a world that reminded the micrological swarms (self-engineered from cyborgs, zombies, and biological species from pre-extinction Earth) of the violence done to their ancestors by this one root of the evolutionary tree, as if it had been dipped in some kind of poison. \nAs Malwise, bent on revenge, the Sentient had felt closed in, his mind dark. Now, ZoAs felt reconciled to his exile on a strange world, in a form that would earn him no respect or status in his home. He was part of a caravan of birds and fish that were ensuring safe passages through the savage earth world of castles and steel. \nThe humans of the post-expansion dimension had softened their stance on Sentient intervention into what they considered “their” history. When the imperialist warships bent on amassing gold and slaves arrived from Europe, the Sentients formed an alliance with the indigenous Peruvians, sending them back over the Atlantic as war-ships, huge swarming clouds of revenge. \nThe humans from the more technologically advanced, yet ecologically impoverished world had no choice but to watch, depending on the Sentients to save their ravaged planet from collapse. Rather than fighting the humans directly, the Sentients played the two worlds off one another. When rebels from the Moon or Lunar Guild would foment unrest, the Earthling post-humans would send them through a gate, to be killed or fend for themselves, as their ancestors determined.\nSeveral of Zoas died, from eating a kind of poisoned fish, and others of him respawned as dragonflies hovering on the underhull of the dirigible. The sentients, like the ice apes, had no technology other than what could be derived from a living ecosystem, although in the case of the post-humans they could take direct telepathic control over their biological form. When the dragonflies were reduced to the last few breeding pairs, ZoAs gestated himself in the womb of a shark, and telepathically suggested to his mother that they follow the shadow of the floating pod. \nThey have been ferrying loads of humans, sentients, and non-sentient plants and animals between the dimension gates. They had just left the mountains of far northen Asia. Human factions on both worlds, suspicious of any communication between dimensions, still posed a threat to the flying caravans. \nZoAs, after interactions with humans, thought that the councils might be exagerrating their danger. The effects of human civilization on their home planet were terrifying, certainly, but the violence came from ignorance, he liked to think, rather than evil.\n\n~Grazano\nOne of the Marquis' cousins had Grazano transferred from the King's prison to a guarded room in his own crypts. This was just before the chaos would engulf Versailles as the Sun Palace and other floating monuments to wealth and ego were transformed into hives of an invasion by telepathic animals. Grazano would know nothing of the fate of the city to which he and the other infamous commedians had traveled, shifted with the palaces themselves into the dimension of the Sentient Earth. \nEven before that, though, there had been rioting, the secret agents of the crown clamping down on protests. Certainly, there would be no more pantomimes or comic acrobats. He thought that he was being led to his death, when they moved him to the palace dungeons, where the apergenetic effects of the gardens' roots served as a rudimentary torture technique. The dottore was hooded as they led him through the streets but he could distinguish clear sounds of rioting. He could barely walk, the disease having destroyed most use of his legs. Was this, he wondered, the price of the gates opening, the new knowledge that his world's religions had, with one voice, denounced as evil? \nAlthough primitive by the standards of the other two dimensions (the one without forests and the one with too many, of the uncanny thinking kind), the scientists in Grazano's world, the ones who corresponded in latin and were terrified of the Yasizis virus erasing their Alexandrias, knew enough about disease to know that when populations mixed, the balance between virulence and immunity was upset, and death was usually the result. Already, the histories of the new world were erasing through omission the knowledge of just how many died of European scourges, their poxes and plagues developed from close contact with pigs, sheep, and cows, all of which he smelt as they led him, without sight, through the filth of the city.\nOne of the guards, if he had been a guard, had told the old actor that they would take him out and shoot him in the morning. It might have been a joke, but at dawn they had come with the yoke and hood, binding his neck and arms in wood and iron. At least the rioters were too busy to pelt him with eggs or cabbage. \nThe dottore had felt himself led onto a platform, a sound almost like the planks of their old stage, and then they pushed him from the small of his back, forcing him to step out...onto the deck of some kind of a ship, it seemed, from the rocking under his weight. Floating ships conveyed none of the sense of movement that a vessel on water did, and there was no sail even to tell him about the wind. His ear strained to make sense of French through the fabric of the hood. \nHe was in a new cell, putting together his fragmented memories, when the black out occurred, and the floating palace fell. He was knocked unconscoius by the crash.\nWhen he woke, the door was opened by an enormous bear.\nThe scary thing for humans, Grazano thought, will be realizing that the things with which you want to identify, aren't always those closest to ourselves. For some people, like me, the alien is more human, more essential.\n\n~Reverse Colonization\nThe Sentients were offering humans refuge on either the pre-or post-expansion worlds. They would no longer be allowed on the surface of the conscious Earth, however. New refugee sitting sprang up along the gate. \nThe Europe of the 17th century, thinking itself the colonizers, were becoming colonized, used for resources in the same way they had planned to do, and had done in alternate histories, to the New Worlders. \nHe never made it back to his home village of Inca Andalu. He was taken by the Sentient, Zoa, \n~Lombarqo\nLombarqo and Rosla, months later, “rescued” dottore, after a dramatic scene in which he fended off legions of the Sun King's army, while waiting for the Shift from the floating mass above them, which was now the palace of the Marquis, with one of the largest groves of ur-trees in Europe. The center of an inter-dimensional battlefield. \nThey then, with the help of the doctor's new post-human friends, took an airship to the new world, then gated to a dimension where post-expansion cities flickered under a ruined sky.\nIn the South, signs of renewed if non-native health was beginning to flow from points of contact with the Sentient and pre-industrial biosphere. \n~Orlando and Malwise\n\nOrlando had no interest in staying in the human cities beginning to reappear in now misnamed Bloodless age, so he had shifted again, through a gate in one of the ancient preserved cities that had been overgrown with a thousand years of trees. \n“Tell me about it,” Malwise said. They were standing on a hill near Lily's husbands house. Malwise had just told Orlando how he had murdered him, how Lily's killer (who had ordered the shot, if not fired the gun himself, who was riding on one of the horses in the stables outside. \n“The ice apes were using the post-expansion age, where they could control the zombies and robots, and were staging attacks through another gate.” Orlando eyed the trees, half-expecting to see huge ape-like forms. “I had no interest in any war. This world, especially people like him,” Orlando gestured towards the unmarked grave, “can be destroyed by the apes and zombies for all I care. The humans from the Slow down were allied with the apes, who needed them to understand the airships and weapons they were using to fight the humans on this Earth.\n“I deserted,” Orlando went on. “So did the man I was traveling with, who joined the telepathic apes against us.”\n“Did you contact the Linguists?” Malwise asked. They had begun walking, through a field with tomato vines beginning to ripen in the early summer afternoon.\n“The ice ape world,” Orlando said, as if he hadn't heard, “Is so beautiful. Like our Earth must have been before we started mining drift feul, cutting down the trees. They could read our minds. The telepaths are willing to leave our world alone, if they can use the Bloodless age universe for hunting. They are only fighting in Egypt to defend themselves. There are telepaths and linguists, but there are other divisions to, like those from the other continent, that they can now reach easier using airships across the post-expansion world...”\nThey didn't talk for a while. Orlando left Malwise by the graves, went back and got his rifle, and shot one of the quail from a huge flock overhead. \n“I've been having drift-memories,” Orlando said as they were eating, smoking tobacco from long pipes. “of myself as one of the last humans. I freeze my body in a suit, and swap minds with someone else.”\n“When I have visions of that world,” Malwise said, “it is of an Earth with no humans on it, or so few as to be insignificant, like we would consider alligators. I am a flock of geese, but also somehow an algorithm in the wings of the geese, a repeating sub-pattern, articulated also in the bacteria of their guts, the routes of their migrations, and the frozen pools or warmer breezes they find to follow.”\nMalwise hadn't been eating the quail, and Orlando now understood why. In the sentient world, animals were more evolutionarily advanced than humans, although not at an organism-level. There were no physical gates to the post-human worlds, so as far as Orlando knew it would have been impossible for telepathic species to migrate through. Unless they were only informtion. Like he had been after his brain was skewered.\n“It isn't like a judgement,” Malwise said, after listening to the cicadas and frogs outside the open window, “what is happening. It's random. Mistakes and misunderstandings are causing unneccesary loss. The only dimensions we can psychically drift to are sealed off from the gates where we could shift through physically...”\n“Still,” Orlando said later, as they were walking, and he paused on a wooden bridge over a freely flowing stream. “I'm glad to be alive.”\n\nTree (Roots)\nThe fire was still burning, and the masked apes still dancing, when Te2ao and Chan2 went on a walk to shake off some of the tiredness and drink. They had filled a gourd, painted and half-broken, with water, that they passed back and forth. The ur-tree roots that had gone into the tea were acting on the telepathic regions of their brains, allowing thought images to be shared as easily as the liquid. They kept their masks on, which were still glowing with the solar energy soaked up from the previous day. The paint gave the muted radiance a spectrum of leaf-and-water tones.\nThe two apes had a greater than usual awareness of themselves as physical objects, seeing their own bodies in each others vision, their perceptions and melodies of mind-images hooking into a tight, reflective loop. The melding seemed easier with the conductance between their bare palms, before they separated their hands to swing up into the trees. \n“What's wrong?” Chan2 asked Te2ao. The full moon was setting over the ocean, and the sun was climbing the mountains on the other side of the sky. The night was almost over. \n“Let's climb out along the ridge,” Te2ao thought to her. The signals from the festival were strong, the music reaching them mentally far beyond the point where they could hear with their ears the drums and singing. Te2ao, as an explanation, sent her a memory from a year ago, when he was meeting her tribe again after scouting ahead through the indifferent area surrounding the coastal mountains. He had climbed an ur-tree, and tried to fight off the feeling that he was going to forget everything that he had experienced in his six cycles of travel, or that the things he had learned would lose their vividness, washed out in the familiar thought-images of his native society. \nHe had carried the iconography of his Coastal tribe far down into the chaotic regions of the South, until he had stood humbled before towering walls of ice, and then inland to the edge of the desert. They were like the charms that dangled from his fur. But they had been repainted, and he had given the mind-images of his youth new meanings, combining them with foreign figures, plants and animals that dwelt in far-off lands. As he was returning home, Te2ao thought to Chan2, he had been afraid that normalcy would drive his had-searched-for insights into oblivion. The songs he had grown melodies for would be drowned out by a common clamour. \n“And you feel the same way now?” Chan2 asked.\n“Yes,” he thought, “only instead of distant lands it is a whole other world we have seen.” Together, the perceptions of the Postponement Earth flashed and flowered in the air before them as they walked, superimposing that remembered, near-lifeless planet, filled with wonders of unthinkable technology. Huge cities connected by the crumbled remains of super-highways, with later lattices of hover-bike tracks, the kind that Vector had suggested, jokingly, the ice-apes build above their own forests. \nThey reached a spot where the tree cover was thin, and they would either have to climb back down or make a jump. Te2ao thought his actions to Chan2 and she agreed, reaching for his hand. He grabbed it, built momentum by swinging back and forth, and then threw her over the gap. She landed safely, and watched as he launched himself through the air, showing off. \n“There is a small grove nearby,” Chan2 said/thought, remembering something that another ice ape had showed her at the Moon gate, a map that corresponded to where they were climbing now. She started to feel the apergy, and dropped down to the ground, landing lighter than she normally would. Te2ao joined her, and they found a telepathic trail leading down through a narrow pass, which then opened out to a spectacular view of the Sea. A East-crawling canyon afforded an aperture for the first lappings of light from the sun. Best of all, there were six medium-sized ur-trees, floating on recently elevated tangles of roots and earth. \nAfter the crashes, and the tidal waves, and the fears of all the other worlders being stranded on a leveled planet, most of the groves and land masses had recovered, barely grazing the Earth. Other planets, they knew, had not been so lucky. \nThey explored the trees, birds anxiously circling their nests, and then retreated from the cold down into a small, cave-like declivity where they could enjoy the view and brightening sky. \n“I don't want things to go back to the way they were before the Drift,” Te2ao said. Chan2 thought to him that there was little danger of that. The Coastal tribes would still keep the Taboo, and fight to keep technology from their forests, but even if the transposition storms ceased, and the islands never drifted between worlds again, and the caves went back to opening out to only one dimension, the ice apes would never go back to thinking of reality the way they did before. The legends were already changing, a new pantheon of concepts and characters springing up alongside the old.\nTe2ao asked her if she wanted to travel back to the postponement Earth, or to the other dimension that Wolftree and Ifza escaped from, another human world, with farms and industrial machines. Orlando and the Bandit were from that continuity. Would the rest of their tribe change their seasonal migrations to allow a stitch into a landscape that, for most of them, would represent a nightmarish future lurking in darkened possibility? \nThey found leaves and tied them in one another's fur, along with beads, cones, and nutshells. They picked off mites and threw them over the edge. The sound of the waves synchronized their visions as they played out in the morning air, memories transmuting into song and narrative. They had, along with Ifza and Wolftree, added their own stories and speeches to the carnival like rituals. Their masks had more recognition after their exploits became known.\nThe maps that the new, inter-dimensional councils were forming were chaotic, covered in broad swaths of uncharted speculation. The ice apes initially seemed willing to let the humans take the drift-ore, but now they were beginning to realize how drastic the process would be, and how much the taboo would have to be broken if the agreements were kept. For the moment, the ice-apes still had the upper hand militarily, with the human's fear of the zombies and golems under the telepath's control. The advantage might shift, though, if the megalopolises from before the Bloodless age could be resurrected, and their ghosts brought back from their hypnogogic sleep. \nThe other ice-apes all seemed to think that war with the Industrial age continuity was inevitable, in some form or another, and the battle-field might be the Postponement Earth, devoid of drift feul but filled with cities of dreaming ghosts waking to be awakened. The humans would regain control over the robot golems, and bring them again over the ice-ape valleys and beaches. \n“We should explore as many worlds as we can,” Te2ao thought, sleepily. “I want to find other groves, linked to different planets, released from the grip of taboo. I want you to come with me.” They wrapped their half-dreamt images in clouds and braided them into their fur, along with tiny bones and carved bits of wood. Smiling, they started back to the fires and celebrations.\nAPPENDIX: SONGS\n\nThe I of the novel, the Inhabitant, or pseudo-ghost, telepathic jellyfish, flock of birds, whatever, left on the Starship. The author, left on the solid Earth of footnotes, did not. Both are grateful, although as the narrator I (neither female nor male, cyborg nor Sentient, primate nor post-human, not entirely any one, definable thing) look up from End or other ports and wonder what happens to worlds after the Drift and Shift gates are established. When the random storms have been calmed and channeled into known and navigable corridors. \nThe six months after the drift were, I imagine more turbulent, with the random storms and unknown dimensions waiting behind unpredictable transpositions. The song of the Drift is about this time in the multi-verse's history when its patterns were tested, yet still retained some of their former continuities. \nThe song of Aza, the head sent into the future, is apocrahpal, since there is no way that the ship could have records of a world thousands of years after the Continuity had passed. The gravitational wake would not have pulled them in. \nOne of my favorites is the song of continue. The starship pulls away from the configuration of worlds it had momentarily mined for drift energy—leaving them enough to survive, but only barely. In compensation, it had given them a way of more intimately knowing the historical pasts and futures they might want to gravitate toward or away from. More star-data on which to plot their course. A multi-space to use when making decisions, or forming alliances.\n\nEPILOGUE\nTe2ao and the Zombies\nBefore this: Safe passage had been granted for some humans and undead through the ice ape world. \nThe council let the zombies, one small herd of them at least, stay behind on the ice ape world. They would travel, spreading the troubling thought of history, and remembered slaughter. Several official reasons, and many more that were rumors, may have effected the decision to let the vegetating corpses roam. One was that the Sentients made it a condition for helping them with the freeze that had been forestalled, but not averted, by the thermal storms, and with the diseases that had resulted from the transpositions. Much of this knowledge, the S entients had rightly argued, was in the zombie group-mind, and accessible to those like Te2ao, and TreLa4. Another reason for the reprieve from the taboo might have been that the zombies alone could detect other zombies, as well as humans from other dimensions, and were the only way the apes had of communicating with them.\nThe last reason, I like to think, was me. At this point, I, Wolftree, was a ghost many times removed. The first life I remember was as a bone-tribe telepath who had faught in the Linguistic wars, when the edict against the unthinkable weapon (fire) had been declared. We had been ambushed after the war was over, and wrestling with a speaking ape, a shaman of unreadable mind, we had both lost our grip in the icy apergenetic force, and fell to the ground. My body was found by the girl whose name, even now, I can't remember, and when she put on my armor, my hatred and fear possessed her. Normally I would have been exorcised, the braided plates of bone and thought-wood burned, but they were defiant of the councils, and knew that the day would come when my memories were needed. I had traveled North, to the Delta, and jumped with Or8o onto the grove of the waterfall as it floated by the bend in the river Um, only to find the forest already destroyed, and most of the priests of speaking killed. As recounted in the above chapters, I was killed by zombies when the island crashed into the ocean, and we barely survived the swim back to shore, only to find it was a different beach, with different stars. \nOr8o put on the thought-wood armor while the images of my (and the ape who had been wearing my ghost) were still caught in the texture of it, and at the same time being absorbed by the zombies, creating a telepathic link between him and the horde. Or8o, in turn, was killed, after reaching his home dimension, in the war against the humans, who brought disease and exploding death in the barrels of guns. So Or8o could talk to TreLa4 one last time, Tre2ao had, reluctantly, worn the armor. By this point, he had been switching minds with humans and Sentients for weeks, so he wasn't surprised to find me, a complex of half-remembered ghosts, in his crowded psyche.\nNot that I spend that much time in The2ao's mind, anymore. The zombies take turns, wearing the armor. The council fears it's power, my power as exactly the kind of being that the taboo was intended to prevent, but more than that they fear the humans, so the let me (and the girl, and Or8o) stay in the air. \nWe weren't allowed near the moon-gate festivals, but we watched them fill the sky from far away, and mimiced them in miniature above our own fires, turning the chaos of the smoke into detailed visions. Te2ao, I knew, liked it better this way, far from the bright points of humming consensus, where small groups could call on their own strange and howling colors. \nMore important than how this novel was written was how it will be remembered. We, as a reader and writer in the unpublished dark, away from the council fires of mechanical mass reproduction, we are left stoking the fires of undead hypotheses. The drift has made all species a little strange. \nPost script\nThe most suspicious of binaries is that of opposing ends of a development, one simple (animal/past) and one complex (technology/future). All evolutionary and historical moments were a “now” just as richly unbeset by entropy as yours or mine. By entropy I mean the dissolution of order, the breaking of an egg by predators or fate, obliterating the potential to elaborate coded instructions. The genetic plain-text drifting into unreadable fog. Is humanity, one wonders, a system of decreasing or increasing entropy? The answer the novel gives is neither: the ratio of signal to noise is always a constant: no age, evolutionary or historical, is more meaningful than any other. \nSuch is the underlying idea for the fictional universe, or multiverse, in which the events of the novel take place. The ice apes have as much claim to a present, in a meta-chronological sense, as the starship, the bloodless age, or the post-human Sentients. None can elevate themselves into a meta or master narrative—all must wait their turn.\n\n~Unscripted\nWhat happens after script, or before it? If the contents of this novel or narrative are always to be available online, evolving in the public domain and creative commons, then you will feel more free, perhaps, to write in the margins, or tear out these pages and fold them into origami owls, or glue then onto the covers of a beaten-up guitar case. You and I, like the human and space-suit, have traveled from the center of the starship to the perimeter, the shore of that great port-city leading out into long distances. I'm guessing neither you nor I can afford the equipment for cryonic storage or lossless download, so our only option, if we want to carry any light or impulse over such long distances, is to develop ways to imitate the thoughts of trees. You and I would, like them, very much like to know the secrets of those obscure, redundant theatrics, but by the time we reach the end, they have already departed to another locus in the warp. \nThat, too was, a message, and the only secret worth imparting: keep moving. Don't fall into traps of stochastic repetition. The only way to follow the Drift was to stay one step behind. \n\n1For the sake of convenience, I've used a simple notation scheme of A,B,C and X,Y,Z to refer to the six different worlds where the narrative takes place, the first three set in the “past” (A is the ice-ape world, B 17th century Europe, C late 19th Century North America), the latter three the “future” dimensions (X the 23rd century in ecological crisis, Y the apocalyptic world of humanity's postponement, and Z the post-human world of a sentient biosphere).\n2Of course, geography is different in your world than those of the novel, but for the sake of simplicity I will use the names from your dimension that correspond most closely with those the characters themselves would use: hence, Lombarqo comes from Spain, and the village of Torn is somewhere in the Papal states of 17th century, pre-unification Italy. \n3The worlds of the novel need to have a religious system similar to Christianity, but influenced by the presence of the anti-gravitational trees and mineral deposits. Rather than dying on the cross, the martyr of these worlds was hanged, upside down, until dead. There were similar stories of his corpse later floating into the air. Heaven, in these dimensions, is thought of as a huge floating island in the sky...\n4On our Earth, Louis XIV.\n5In your dimension, Alfred Russell Wallace and Charles Darwin co-published theories of evolution through random mutation and natural selection in 1859. Herbert Spencer, a few years later, published a more ambitious, and at the time more influential philosophy of progressive, spiritual evolution. \n6Edward Bellamy published Looking Backward, about a futuristic Boston, in the year 1888.\n7 There was plenty of information, and species from the past theoretically could be cloned for the needed diversity, but a viable ecosystem required an enormous amount of resources.\n8In this dimension, it would be called a Markov model. \n9At this point, one of the characters in the novel (presumably the narrative algorithm, the Inhabitant) is presu\nming to speak for the actual author of the document, simply because he has availed himself of a new typeface, when if any 21st century print convention conveys authorial dignity, it is the last word, which is to say, the footnote!\n10Dreams, as conspiracy theorists on our Earth have suggested—might simply have been live feeds to other realities.\n11At this point in the novel though, beginning with the drift, chronology begins to veer away from history. It becomes possible to speak of large-scale effects of psychic transpositions between dimensions\n12Olympus Mons on Mars is the highest mountain in the solar system, and Aitken basin is the deepest crater.\n13That crack is what gives away, in the web comic, when the space-suit is Lambent, and when it is The Inhabitant, or the version of Lambent after he becomes a pseudo-ghost.\n\n",
